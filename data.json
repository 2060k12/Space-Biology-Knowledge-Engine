    "abstract": "After a 16-year hiatus, Russia has resumed its program of biomedical research in space, with the successful 30-day flight of the Bion-M 1 biosatellite (April 19–May 19, 2013). The principal species for biomedical research in this project was the mouse. This paper presents an overview of the scientific goals, the experimental design and the mouse training/selection program. The aim of mice experiments in the Bion-M 1 project was to elucidate cellular and molecular mechanisms, underlying the adaptation of key physiological systems to long-term exposure in microgravity. The studies with mice combined in vivo measurements, both in flight and post-flight (including continuous blood pressure measurement), with extensive in vitro studies carried out shortly after return of the mice and in the end of recovery study. Male C57/BL6 mice group housed in space habitats were flown aboard the Bion-M 1 biosatellite, or remained on ground in the control experiment that replicated environmental and housing conditions in the spacecraft. Vivarium control groups were used to account for housing effects and possible seasonal differences. Mice training included the co-adaptation in housing groups and mice adaptation to paste food diet. The measures taken to co-adapt aggressive male mice in housing groups and the peculiarities of “space” paste food are described. The training program for mice designated for in vivo studies was broader and included behavioral/functional test battery and continuous behavioral measurements in the home-cage. The results of the preliminary tests were used for the selection of homogenous groups. After the flight, mice were in good condition for biomedical studies and displayed signs of pronounced disadaptation to Earth's gravity. The outcomes of the training program for the mice welfare are discussed. We conclude that our training program was effective and that male mice can be successfully employed in space biomedical research.",
    "introduction": "After a 16-year hiatus, Russia resumed in 2013 its program of biomedical research in space, with the successful 30-day flight of the Bion-M 1 biosatellite (April 19–May 19, 2013), a specially designed automated spacecraft dedicated to life-science experiments. “M” in the mission's name stands for “modernized”; the epithet was equally applicable to the spacecraft and the research program. The principal animal species for physiological studies in this mission was the mouse (Mus musculus). Unlike more recent space experiments that used female mice, males were flown in the Bion-M 1 mission. The challenging task of supporting mice in space for this unmanned, automated, 30-day-long mission, was made even more so by the requirement to house the males in groups. Russian biomedical research in space traditionally has employed dogs, rats, monkeys, and more recently Mongolian gerbils. The flight of Laika in 1957 was one of the early dog experiments and became world famous for demonstrating that a living organism can withstand rocket launch and weightlessness, thus paving the way for the first human spaceflight. Laika's success also promoted biomedical research with other non-human animals in space that culminated with the Bion biosatellites program. A total of 212 rats and 12 monkeys were launched on 11 satellites and exposed in microgravity for 5.0–22.5 days between 1973 and 1997. Animal experiments on the Bion missions have contributed comprehensive data on adaptive responses of sensorimotor, cardiovascular, muscle, bone and other systems to spaceflight conditions and the mechanisms underlying these adaptations [1], [2]. The use of mice for space experiments offers numerous advantages. Probably the most apparent one is their small size and thus the possibility of utilizing more animals per flight, thus increasing scientific output and the cost-efficiency ratio. Comparisons of data obtained with mice, with those obtained from larger species or humans can also reveal how factors affecting adaptation to spaceflight conditions depend on the size of the organism. The mouse has become the most prevalent “mammalian model” in biomedical research, with a fully described genome and an established role in genetically engineered mutants. While mice are preferred mammalian models for molecular biology studies, their small size is a debated limitation rather than an advantage for physiological studies. Miniaturization of scientific hardware has reduced some of the disadvantages of the species small size. Finally, the use of genetically controlled mice offers a means to reduce inter-individual variability and obtain potentially more consistent results. Despite the advantages of the mouse as a model organism for space research, their use was rather limited (apart from a number of experiments with mice during early space exploration in the 1950's and 1960's, which were aimed primarily at testing if living organisms can survive the launch or a brief exposure in microgravity) [3]. Flight experiments with mice were performed aboard STS-90 (“NeuroLab”), STS-108, STS-129, STS-131 (“Mouse Immunology I”), STS-133 (“Mouse Immunology II”), and STS-135 with exposure times ranging from 12 to 16 days. Research programs of these flights were largely focused on studies of muscle, bone/tendon/cartilage, nervous, and cardiovascular systems, and innate and acquired immune responses. Experiments were performed with groups of 30 or fewer female C57BL/6J mice, which were dissected typically shortly after return [4]–[9]. The Mice Drawer System (MDS) experiment of the Italian Space Agency is by far the longest spaceflight of mice to date [10]. In this mission, 6 mice were exposed for 91 days aboard the International Space Station. The advantages offered by the possibility of genetic manipulations with mice were utilized in this experiment; three mice were transgenic with pleiotrophin overexpression (C57BLJ10/ PTN) and three mice were their wild-type counterparts. The MDS habitats required periodic replenishment and servicing by by astronauts. Sadly, half of the mice died during the course of this mission due to various estimated reasons. In the present paper we aim to present a brief overview of the Bion-M 1 mission scientific goals and experimental design. Of particular interest we will focus on the program of mouse training and selection for the experiments, and some outcomes of the Bion-M 1 mission.",

    "abstract": "Bone is a dynamically remodeled tissue that requires gravity-mediated mechanical stimulation for maintenance of mineral content and structure. Homeostasis in bone occurs through a balance in the activities and signaling of osteoclasts, osteoblasts, and osteocytes, as well as proliferation and differentiation of their stem cell progenitors. Microgravity and unloading are known to cause osteoclast-mediated bone resorption; however, we hypothesize that osteocytic osteolysis, and cell cycle arrest during osteogenesis may also contribute to bone loss in space. To test this possibility, we exposed 16-week-old female C57BL/6J mice (n = 8) to microgravity for 15-days on the STS-131 space shuttle mission. Analysis of the pelvis by µCT shows decreases in bone volume fraction (BV/TV) of 6.29%, and bone thickness of 11.91%. TRAP-positive osteoclast-covered trabecular bone surfaces also increased in microgravity by 170% (p = 0.004), indicating osteoclastic bone degeneration. High-resolution X-ray nanoCT studies revealed signs of lacunar osteolysis, including increases in cross-sectional area (+17%, p = 0.022), perimeter (+14%, p = 0.008), and canalicular diameter (+6%, p = 0.037). Expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) 1, 3, and 10 in bone, as measured by RT-qPCR, was also up-regulated in microgravity (+12.94, +2.98 and +16.85 fold respectively, p<0.01), with MMP10 localized to osteocytes, and consistent with induction of osteocytic osteolysis. Furthermore, expression of CDKN1a/p21 in bone increased 3.31 fold (p<0.01), and was localized to osteoblasts, possibly inhibiting the cell cycle during tissue regeneration as well as conferring apoptosis resistance to these cells. Finally the apoptosis inducer Trp53 was down-regulated by −1.54 fold (p<0.01), possibly associated with the quiescent survival-promoting function of CDKN1a/p21. In conclusion, our findings identify the pelvic and femoral region of the mouse skeleton as an active site of rapid bone loss in microgravity, and indicate that this loss is not limited to osteoclastic degradation. Therefore, this study offers new evidence for microgravity-induced osteocytic osteolysis, and CDKN1a/p21-mediated osteogenic cell cycle arrest.",
    "introduction": "On Earth, at 1 g, mechanical loading of mammalian tissues is an important factor in maintaining tissue health and promoting normal regenerative growth. Forces generated by gravity such as hydrostatic pressure, stretch, and fluid shear are well known to promote normal tissue growth and repair mechanisms. Conversely, during spaceflight, gravity-generated forces are absent and the mechanical stimulation of tissues is greatly diminished. Direct and immediate physiological responses to microgravity-induced mechanical unloading include adaptive losses of bone [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6] and muscle mass [7], [8], [9], [10], and alterations in cardiovascular function [11], [12], [13], [14]. Because of practical reasons, most space biological animal research has focused on the short-term effects of spaceflight, and thus our understanding of long-term effects of microgravity exposure is very limited. However, it is likely that over long periods of time mechanical unloading in microgravity may continue to affect tissue regenerative growth and repair, resulting in more widespread degenerative effects. Alternatively, it is also possible that cells and tissues may adapt to microgravity and reach a new homeostatic level appropriate for health maintenance under reduced mechanical load conditions. Since normal tissue repair and regeneration is dependent on the ability of adult stem cells to proliferate and differentiate, we have hypothesized that during long-term spaceflight, the reduction in gravity mechano-stimulation may decrease regenerative proliferation and differentiation of tissue-specific adult stem cells. This in turn may have significant health consequences for multiple tissues throughout the body, including bone. Specifically for bone tissue, short-duration exposure to microgravity rapidly leads to alterations in bone mineral content, cellular dynamics, and gene expression patterns [15], [16], [17], [18], [19]. This is illustrated by a 1–2% loss of skeletal mineral in weight-bearing bones per month [17], which poses significant risks for long-duration and interplanetary missions. Because bone remodeling homeostasis depends on tightly coupled mineral deposition and resorption [20], [21], uncoupling of these processes in microgravity can cause increased and rapid bone resorption by osteoclasts, and decreased bone formation by osteoblasts [17], [18], [22], [23]. Increased osteoclast bone resorptive activity has been documented within the first several days of spaceflight [1], [17] and may be reduced after a period of transition and adaptation to microgravity. However, of potentially more importance to long duration missions in microgravity is the reported reduction of bone formation by osteoblasts in growing rats [24], [25], [26], although, this result has not been reproduced. In skeletally mature animals, this bone formation arrest may translate into an impairment of regenerative mechanisms, and therefore may be an important long-term factor in spaceflight. Short of conducting long-term experiments with rodents in space, analysis of the early cell cycle arrest signaling pathways in osteogenic bone cells after short-term spaceflight is the most practical current approach to predict the long-term degenerative effects of microgravity. To perform this analysis we focused on the activation of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis pathways such as those mediated by the tumor and growth suppressor, p53, and the cell cycle inhibitor, CDKN1a/p21. P53 levels are reported to increase in the muscle of hindlimb-unloaded animals [27], potentially leading to cell cycle arrest and/or apoptosis. Furthermore, p53 knockout mice have preserved trabecular bone volume following hindlimb-unloading [28] and generally, osteopetrotic bone, suggesting a role for the p53-signaling pathway in the regulation of bone formation and degradation [29], [30]. More remarkably, the CDKN1a/p21 knockout mouse has a viable phenotype with strong tissue regenerative abilities, such as limb re-growth, otherwise unheard of in adult mammals [31]. CDKN1a/p21 can be activated by environmental conditions such as oxidative stress and radiation, or be part of normal cell cycle arrest mechanisms during cell differentiation. This phenotype suggests CDKN1a/p21 up-regulation in microgravity could explain broad regenerative deficits in space. Recent studies have highlighted the potential role of osteocytes, terminally differentiated osteoblasts embedded within the mineralized matrix, in the bone remodeling process, including in osteolysis of the lacunar surface for maintenance of calcium homeostasis [32], [33]. Results from light and electron microscopy of rat bone in a 22-day spaceflight experiment conducted in 1977 indicated the appearance of lacunae changed to a “wide” morphology that could contribute to bone loss in space [34]. Recently, it was found that osteocytes acquired a more rounded shape after 91-days in microgravity during the Mice Drawer System experiment on ISS, albeit no statistical significance was obtained due to low n, and the authors did not conclude that osteocytic degradation of the lacunae surface was occurring [35]. On the other hand, osteocytic osteolysis was shown to be present in lactating mice but not activated in animals that were hindlimb unloaded for 4 weeks [36], leaving the potential role and importance of osteocytic osteolysis during spaceflight an open question. To address the limited understanding of cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying bone degeneration in space following the initial osteoclastic activation, we focused on the processes related to osteoblastic and osteocytic activities. We hypothesized that decreases in bone formation during spaceflight may be mediated by an inability of cells in osteogenic lineages to proliferate and differentiate normally due to reduced mechanical stimuli in microgravity. Finally, we also hypothesized that reduced mechanostimulation of osteocytes in microgravity may signal the activation of osteocytic osteolysis of lacunar surfaces, with accompanying activation of matrix degradation pathways. Our spaceflight results presented here, suggest that the bone degenerative effects of microgravity in skeletally mature mice go beyond rapid osteoclastic activation, affecting also cell cycle regulation in the osteogenic lineage, and inducing osteocytic osteolysis.",

    "conclusion": "In this study, we investigated cellular and molecular gene expression mechanisms underlying bone degeneration in space, with an emphasis on the processes related to osteoblastic and osteocytic activities in the pelvic girdle and proximal femur of 16-week-old C57BL/6J female mice. Although data in this field is not extensive, exposure to microgravity is known to alter bone homeostasis, causing primarily increased osteoclast-mediated bone resorption, and possibly inhibition of bone formation. Here we sought to test the hypothesis that like osteoclastic activity, osteogenic cell cycle arrest and increased osteocytic osteolysis, may also contribute to bone loss in space. We first characterized standard bone mineral and structural parameters following spaceflight to establish the magnitude of bone loss in our microgravity model system. Our results confirm the ischium portion of the pelvis (Fig. 1A) lost 6.3% (p = 0.005) bone volume fraction and 11.9% (p = 0.002) in bone thickness (Table 1) with an accompanying reduction in trabecular bridges between ischial surfaces (Fig. 1E–G). In addition, bone loss was accompanied by large increases in osteoclast numbers (197%) and osteoclast-covered trabecular bone surfaces measured in the femoral head (154%) (Fig. 3A–D). This observed initial (15-day) rate of bone loss, translated to approximately 12%–24% loss per month, is high compared to established long-term astronaut bone loss values of 1–2% per month. The high-levels of osteoclastic activity we observed may, however, subside after the initial transition to microgravity. On earth at 1 g, patients with tetraplegia show an initial phase of pronounced cancellous bone loss, up to 30%, that subsides one-year post onset of paralysis [37]. Bed rest also results in increased osteoclast activity within 24 h of immobilization [38], and 120 d bed rest causes increased bone resorption surfaces in the pelvis by osteoclasts [39]. After this initial phase of osteoclastic resorption in patients, cortical bone loss continues, although at a reduced rate that is medically more manageable. If osteoclastic activity returns to normal after a period of transition after unloading, continued bone loss may correspond to reduced osteogenic activity and osteocytic osteolysis. Finally, the geometry of the ischium in flight samples is also altered with a wider marrow cavity conformation than ground controls (Fig. 1B–D, Table 2). Specifically, bone geometry near the ischial tuberosity, which provides a hindlimb muscle attachment surface, appears most altered. Among the muscles attaching to the ischium, the quadratus femoris plays an important “antigravity” role in maintaining a neutral hind-limb posture and can atrophy in microgravity [40], possibly explaining the high levels of bone loss we observed in the pelvis. Having established that microgravity induces high-levels of osteoclast-mediated bone resorption in our model system, we then sought to determine if osteocytic osteolysis was also activated. Osteocytes, are the most abundant cell type in bone and are thought to play a role in spaceflight-induced bone loss [41], [42], [43]. Lacunar enlargement was previously reported in a 22-day spaceflight in the 1970s with juvenile rats but was not conclusively demonstrated [34]. However, mice subjected to hindlimb unloading do not show increased lacunar area, suggesting that osteocytic osteolysis does not play a role in bone loss due to hindlimb unloading at 1 g [36]. Using nanoCT (Fig. 2), we found no bone density differences in non-lacunar regions between flight and ground samples. However, flight samples did exhibit lacunar enlargement relative to ground controls, as well as decreased circularity, and increased canalicular diameter (Fig. 2C–G). These results suggest an increase in osteocytic degradation of lacunar surfaces and highlight a possible difference in the ground-based model for mechanical hindlimb unloading at 1 g versus unloading in microgravity. Furthermore, the number of TRAP-positive osteocytes in flight samples was increased compared to ground controls, with no apparent differences in cell death or lacunar emptying (Fig. 3E–H). Although TRAP is an iron containing enzyme known to be a specific and highly sensitive marker of bone resorption by osteoclasts, Nakano et al (2004) also showed TRAP activity in osteocytes [44]. TRAP-active osteocytes in the trabecular and cortical bone may therefore contribute to bone resorption in lacunae [44]. Furthermore, Qing et al (2012) found that gene expression analysis of osteocyte-enriched bone from lactating mice exhibited increased expression of TRAP, as well as several other osteoclast specific genes such as cathepsin K, carbonic anhydrase 1 and 2, and MMP13 [36]. TRAP may also be needed for normal bone mineral remodeling and endochondral ossification, as mice lacking TRAP exhibit an osteopetrotic phenotype [45]. It is currently debated whether osteocytes contribute to bone remodeling and loss during spaceflight (for full review see [33]), however, our results support a role for microgravity-induced osteocytic osteolysis. To further investigate osteocyte-mediated molecular mechanisms associated with bone loss in space, we analyzed gene expression changes relevant to bone extracellular matrix in marrow-free bone tissue containing predominantly osteocytes but also osteoblasts. We found increases in mRNA levels for several collagen molecules and laminin subunits, suggesting increased matrix remodeling, and significant up-regulation of mRNA for matrix metalloproteinases 1, 3, and 10 in flight samples compared to ground controls, while MMP inhibitors showed no statistically significant alterations in expression (Fig. 4, Table 3). Remarkably we also found that osteocytes embedded within the cortical bone of the proximal femur were strongly MMP10 positive in flight samples but not in ground controls, indicating that the up-regulation of MMP10 transcripts in flight samples may originate in osteocytes. ECM proteinases play a critical role in normal pericellular matrix remodeling following environmental stimuli, such as mechanical load, and matrix calcium regulation in normal physiological states as well as in many disease states, such as rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis [46], [47], [48]. Previous studies have shown that osteoclasts secrete MMP1 and 3 during bone remodeling [49]. Furthermore, stromelysins (MMP3 and 10) retain significant activity in the acidic environment found in osteoclast resorptive pits and are secreted by osteoclasts in the sub-osteoclastic resorptive zone [49]. The number of dendritic processes from an osteocyte also increases with age, indicating that osteocytes embedded within the mineralized matrix may have the ability to generate new processes [50], [51]. In total, this gene and protein expression data, together with the ability of osteocytes to express the osteoclast marker TRAP and MMP10, support a role for osteocytic osteolysis in microgravity. In addition to a role for osteocytic osteolysis, we also hypothesized that bone loss in space may be mediated by intracellular signaling cascades that result in activation of p53 and p21 during osteogenesis. Tumor suppressor protein 53 (p53) is a growth suppressor and a transcriptional regulator which modulates the expression of a wide range of genes involved in cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and differentiation [52] and p53 activation generally results in apoptosis. Mice null for p53 exhibit extensive blood tumors and an osteopetrotic bone phenotype, indicating a role for the p53 signaling pathway in the regulation of bone formation and degradation [29], [30]. Previous studies have also demonstrated that p53 levels are increased in the muscle of animals exposed to spaceflight [27] and that p53 knockout mice have preserved trabecular bone volume following hindlimb unloading [28]. In contrast to these findings we determined that mRNA expression levels of p53 in marrow free bone tissue was down-regulated and immunohistochemical analysis showed no nuclear or cytoplasmic accumulation of p53. Furthermore, examination of osteocyte nuclei in lacunae from cortical bone of the femur also revealed no differences in the number of empty lacunae, or nuclei with pyknotic morphology in spaceflight versus ground control animals. Previous research, however, has found that hindlimb unloading can result in osteocyte apoptosis and bone loss in the lumbar region of the spine [41]. Research into spaceflight versus 1 g simulations of spaceflight has, however, found differences in bone loss mechanisms including in trabecular bone loss, cancellous mineralization, and bone resorption rates [53]. Our data, including decreased message levels of p53, lack of protein accumulation of p53, and no alterations in osteocytic cell death, suggests that in contrast to hindlimb unloading, osteocyte apoptosis is mostly absent in short-term spaceflight. Previous studies have shown that periosteal bone formation is inhibited [25] and osteoblast populations are decreased [24] in response to spaceflight, however, the molecular mechanisms causing this arrest of bone formation are not yet known. In contrast to p53, which we found to be down-regulated, expression of CDKN1a/p21, a cell cycle arrest mediator immediately downstream of p53, and other stress response pathways were up-regulated during spaceflight (Fig. 6, Table 3), which may cause an inhibition of osteogenesis and bone formation. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that p21 in flight samples was strongly localized to osteoblast nuclei on the periosteal surface of the femur and near the femoral head. In addition, spaceflight animals showed increased nuclear p21 staining in muscle fibers attached to the femur. MRL mice, which regenerate cartilage, skin, hair follicles, and myocardium with high fidelity and without scarring [54], also lack p21 expression, providing evidence that p21 could play a role in inhibiting tissue regeneration. In addition, CDKN1a/p21 knockout mice also have a regenerative phenotype similar to MRL mice, with normal development, early entry into S phase of the cell cycle, enhanced proliferation, and sensitivity to UV-induced apoptosis [31]. Elevated CDKN1a/p21 levels in spaceflight may therefore explain the observed reduction in osteogenesis and bone growth. The expression of CDKN1a/p21 may also occur in tissues, possibly resulting in a systemic cell cycle and tissue regenerative response. In addition to bone, our gene expression results also show accumulation of p21 in muscle (Fig. 6) and heart tissue (A. Kumar, E.A.C. Almeida, and R.K. Globus, unpublished results). One possible mechanism for systemic expression of CDKN1a/p21 in the mouse may be oxidative stress induced by reactive oxygen species (ROS). Elevated levels of ROS can result in increased lipid peroxidation and decreased levels of antioxidants, which have been reported both in spaceflight and hindlimb-unloading studies [55], [56], [57], [58]. Although the effect of CDKN1a/p21 accumulation in muscle and cardiomyocytes is not addressed in this study, it is possible that a systemic activation of CDKN1a/p21 by ROS could be occurring and might interfere with generalized tissue proliferation, repair and regeneration. Various other genes associated with cell cycle regulation were altered in response to spaceflight, including cell cycle arrest molecules and cell cycle regulation molecules (Table 3). Such molecules included up-regulation of Fbxo4 and Fbxo31 that have been shown to stimulate the ubiquitination of Ccnd1 [59], [60], [61]. Ccnd1 promotes the transition from G1 to S phase of the cell cycle and is also considered a mediator of signaling from extracellular stimuli to the cell cycle machinery. Furthermore, several of the up-regulated molecules, specifically, Ube2e3 and Mul1, are thought to be involved in cell growth arrest due to mitochondrial fragmentation. Although we have found no cellular evidence of increased apoptosis, several apoptosis-related genes were also up-regulated in flight samples including Cradd, Dapk1, Fbxo31, Hecw2 and MAPK10 (Table 3). The expression of these genes without increased cellular indications of apoptosis could be related to the survival-promoting function of p21 when the cell cycle is arrested. In order to determine the influence of spaceflight on osteogenic signaling pathways, we conducted RT-qPCR analysis of growth factor transcripts for genes involved in osteogenesis, bone mineralization, and their regulatory transcription factors. Altered growth factor binding in particular, can have significant impacts on intracellular signaling cascades and gene expression. We found message expression reductions in TGF-β2; FGF1 and 3; BMP4; Egr1; and Csf3 (Fig. 5, Table 3). Tgf-β is produced by osteoblasts and deposited in bone matrix during bone formation, and released by osteoclasts during bone resorption [62]. Additionally, Tgf-β induces proliferation and differentiation in osteoblasts while inhibiting osteoclast precursor differentiation and bone resorption [63], [64]. Decreased levels of Tgf-β in the hindlimb of flight samples compared to ground controls has previously been reported. Tgf-β has also been suggested to play a critical role in the mechanosensing ability of bone and bone cells by serving as an intracellular messenger between strain responsive cells and other bone cells [65]. Decreased levels of Tgf-β in the periosteum but not in the cancellous compartment of the hindlimb, correlated with decreases in periosteal bone formation and mineral deposition rates, are suggestive of a role for Tgf-β in mechanical-loading-induced bone formation. We also found decreases in the expression levels of Bmp4 message (Table 3), which is one of the most potent inducers of bone formation through stimulation of osteoblast differentiation. It has recently been shown that Bmp4-induced cell cycle arrest during osteoblast differentiation is dependent on the induction of p21 and p27 expression [66]. Several additional genes associated with cell growth and differentiation including Myod1, Twist1, and Egr1 were also altered in spaceflight (Fig. 5A, Table 3). Myod1 is known for its function in muscle cells where it causes increased differentiation through activation of p21 [67]. Myod1, however, is also broadly expressed in other tissues and down-regulation of Myod1 message is suggestive of decreased p21-mediated cell differentiation. In agreement with this, Twist 1, known to be involved in differentiation by inhibiting DNA binding by Myod1 and transactivation by Mef2, was up-regulated. Decreased Myod1 expression suggests a decrease in CDKN1a/p21 levels associated with cell differentiation, and leads us to hypothesize that the CDKN1a/p21 elevation we observe in spaceflight is independent of differentiation, and possibly induced by the oxidative stress related to reduced mechanical load in microgravity. Egr1 has been shown to be regulated by c-Fos [68], however, Egr1 activation has also been shown to occur independently of c-Fos through activation of the Erk 1/2 pathway in response to shear stress. Although the exact mechanism regulating Egr1 activity is not examined here, down-regulation of this molecule has important implications for cell growth and differentiation due to its potential role in the regulation of over 30 genes. Furthermore, decreased levels of Egr1 leads to decreased formation of the Egr1/Sp1 complex resulting in increased levels of free Sp1 available for binding to the m-CSF promoter, increased m-CSF expression, and consequently, more osteoclast formation [69]. The observed decreases in TGF-β message could also contribute to decreased Egr-1 expression. Vitamin D receptor and Sox9, two transcription factors involved in osteogenesis, were also differentially expressed in spaceflight. Vdr gene expression is stimulated by Ras/Raf/MAP kinase signaling through the AP-1 site on the Vdr promoter [46], [70]. Vitamin D has been shown to modulate NFκB activity in multiple cell types, which suggests a role for the Vitamin D receptor in regulation of the NFκB pathway. Vdr-null mice have been shown to have decreased IκBα levels due to loss of vdr-p65 interaction affecting NFκB transcriptional activity [48]. This could provide an additional mechanism for the observed inhibition of NFκB activation in our spaceflight samples. The MAP kinase-ERK pathway is also known to activate the transcription factor Sox9 [71], which is a regulatory factor required for chondrocyte differentiation [72]. Activation of Sox9 by p38-MAP kinase signaling results in chondrocyte growth and differentiation while depression of Sox9 transcription results in cartilage degeneration and osteo-arthritis [55], [73]. Additionally, Sox9 is important for extracellular matrix production [73]. P38-MAP kinase down-regulation and loss of Sox9 transcriptional activation may therefore have important implications for cartilage health and regeneration, and matrix production in spaceflight. Rps6kb1, a down-stream effector of the Pi3K/Akt/mTOR pathway, was also down-regulated in spaceflight (Table 3), and is involved in cell proliferation through the activation of protein synthesis by Eif4e and inhibition of apoptosis through phosphorylation of BAD (for full review see [56]).",

    "abstract": "Microgravity, defined by minimal gravitational forces, represents a unique environment that profoundly influences biological systems, including human cells. This review examines the effects of microgravity on biological processes and their implications for human health. Microgravity significantly impacts the immune system by disrupting key mechanisms, such as T cell activation, cytokine production, and macrophage differentiation, leading to increased susceptibility to infections. In cancer biology, it promotes the formation of spheroids in cancer stem cells and thyroid cancer cells, which closely mimic in vivo tumor dynamics, providing novel insights for oncology research. Additionally, microgravity enhances tissue regeneration by modulating critical pathways, including Hippo and PI3K-Akt, thereby improving stem cell differentiation into hematopoietic and cardiomyocyte lineages. At the organ level, microgravity induces notable changes in hepatic metabolism, endothelial function, and bone mechanotransduction, contributing to lipid dysregulation, vascular remodeling, and accelerated bone loss. Notably, cardiomyocytes derived from human pluripotent stem cells and cultured under microgravity exhibit enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis, improved calcium handling, and advanced structural maturation, including increased sarcomere length and nuclear eccentricity. These advancements enable the development of functional cardiomyocytes, presenting promising therapeutic opportunities for treating cardiac diseases, such as myocardial infarctions. These findings underscore the dual implications of microgravity for space medicine and terrestrial health. They highlight its potential to drive advances in regenerative therapies, oncology, and immunological interventions. Continued research into the biological effects of microgravity is essential for protecting astronaut health during prolonged space missions and fostering biomedical innovations with transformative applications on Earth.",
    "introduction": "Microgravity, a condition characterized by minimal and almost imperceptible gravitational forces, occurs primarily in space or in specialized environments designed to simulate this state [1,2]. In cellular biology, microgravity presents a unique opportunity to study how cells respond to the drastic reduction in gravity—a fundamental factor that regulates numerous cellular processes on Earth [3,4,5]. Under microgravity conditions, mechanical forces that influence cell structure and function undergo significant alterations, impacting cytoskeletal organization, cell adhesion, and intracellular signaling. These changes in turn affect critical cellular processes, including proliferation, differentiation, communication, and survival [4,5,6]. Historically, research on microgravity has been conducted aboard space stations, such as the International Space Station, and on suborbital platforms. More recently, terrestrial laboratories have adopted advanced technologies, such as rotating bioreactors, to simulate microgravity conditions [1,7,8]. These investigations, conducted both in space and on Earth, have gained importance due to their dual applications: safeguarding astronaut health and addressing terrestrial diseases [1,9,10]. This review aims to explore recent advances in understanding the effects of microgravity on biological processes, emphasizing its implications and applications for human health.",

    "title": "Microgravity Reduces the Differentiation and Regenerative Potential of Embryonic Stem Cells",
    "link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7998608/",
    "abstract": "Therapeutic effects of adult stem-cell transplantations are limited by poor cell-retention in target organs, and a reduced potential for optimal cell differentiation compared to embryonic stem cells. However, contemporary studies have indicated heterogeneity within adult stem-cell pools, and a novel culturing technique may address these limitations by selecting those for cell proliferation which are highly functional. Here, we report the preservation of stemness in human adipose-derived stem cells (hASCs) by using microgravity conditions combined with microspheres in a stirred suspension. The cells were bound to microspheres (100−300 μm) and cultured using a wave-stirring shaker. One-week cultures using polystyrene and collagen microspheres increased the proportions of SSEA-3(+) hASCs 4.4- and 4.3-fold (2.7- and 2.9-fold increases in their numbers), respectively, compared to normal culture conditions. These cultured hASCs expressed higher levels of pluripotent markers (OCT4, SOX2, NANOG, MYC, and KLF), and had improved abilities for proliferation, colony formation, network formation, and multiple-mesenchymal differentiation. We believe that this novel culturing method may further enhance regenerative therapies using hASCs.",
    "introduction": "Human adipose-derived stem cells (hASCs) are easily isolated therapeutic stem cells from adipose tissue. They have increasingly been used to ameliorate a broad range of refractory diseases, including irradiated tissue [1], ischemic wounds [2], and diabetic ulcers [3]. However, their clinical efficacy has been limited because the long-term survival of transplanted hASCs is diminished by environmental stress [4,5,6]. Consequently, hASC therapeutic mechanisms have been limited to the secretion of cytokines and growth factors to promote cell recruitment, immunomodulation, extracellular matrix remodeling, and angiogenesis [7,8,9,10]. In contrast, embryonic stem cells retain their potency and are thought to be superior to adult stem cells for regenerative potential [11]. However, the use of embryonic stem cells is limited by ethical issues [12]. Modern research has made gains toward a better understanding of stem-cell heterogeneity [13,14]. Within stem-cell pools (previously thought to be homogenous), a surprising degree of subpopulation dynamics in gene expression has been revealed related to tissue regeneration, cell survival, proliferation, and stemness [15]. This concept of functional individuality within a stem-cell pool is especially important for hASCs, because cells with higher functional properties would be expected to have more promising therapeutic benefits through an increased capacity to survive under difficult conditions, to differentiate into various mesenchymal cell types, and to home into damaged tissues [16,17,18]. One example of a highly functional hASC candidate is the multilineage-differentiating stress-enduring (Muse) cell, which can be isolated from hASCs using its expression of stage-specific embryonic antigen-3 (SSEA-3) [19] and has been reported to have novel potential for liver cirrhosis [20], brain infarction [21], and aortic aneurysm [22] treatments. An additional problem is that the expansion of such highly-pluripotent cell populations is quite difficult. Adhesion-based cultures, the standard technique for in vitro expansion of hASCs, are known to lead to a gradual quiescence in stemness indicated, for example, by a decline in CD34 positivity [23]. In contrast, suspension-type cultures have also been used successfully for temporary cultivations of Muse cells, and although the mechanism is unknown, it has been reported that a microgravity (i.e., weightless) environment had a positive effect on stem-cell cultures for maintenance of their original potencies [24]. However, the forced-floating of hASC cultures using non-adherent dishes caused spherical aggregations and oxygen/nutrient diffusion limits, which resulted in central necrosis in hASC spheroids [25]. There is, therefore, an urgent need for new and advanced culture techniques to permit the selective expansion of hASC subpopulations with improved properties for proliferation, differentiation, angiogenesis, immunosuppression, and stress-resistance. The microcarrier system was first introduced in 1967 for the growth of fibroblasts [26], and has been used for the expansion of other adherent cells such as chondrocytes [27], hepatocytes [28], neural stem cells [29], and hASCs [30,31]. Microcarriers are usually small spherical particles which can adhere to cultivated cells and are characterized by higher surface-to-volume ratios that can accommodate higher cell densities compared to monolayer cultures. Most importantly, under the dynamic conditions of continuous shaking, microcarrier culturing has a multidirectional gravity effect on the adhered cells, effectively mimicking floating cultures. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the ability of dynamic microgravity culturing of hASCs using microcarriers to selectively expand highly functional stem-cell subpopulations.",
    "results": "",
    "conclusion": "Through novel advances in cell biology, adult stem cells (including hASCs) have been shown to be truly heterogeneous, with subpopulations of cells that may offer potentially greater translational benefits. SSEA-3(+) Muse cells, a representative type of highly functional mesenchymal stem cell, are known to show superior multipotency compared to regular stem cells [32]. However, although routine two-dimensional cultures allow hASCs to expand easily, these conditions adversely affect the proliferation of cells with higher multipotent properties, reducing the usual proportion of SSEA-3(+) hASCs to only approximately 1% [19]. Growing evidence suggests that mechanical and environmental stress greatly influences proliferation, self-renewal, differentiation, and the multipotency of stem cells [33,34]. Among possible sources of stress, gravity may historically have been the most underappreciated microenvironment stress, because of its constant influence on cultured cells. Numerous studies have reported the impact of microgravity conditions on stem-cell proliferation [35] and differentiation [36,37]. Notably, human mesenchymal stem cells cultured in a microgravity environment usually demonstrate suppressed differentiation [38]. Therefore, some highly functional stem cells may be able to retain their undifferentiated, unaltered phenotypes if they can avoid the force of gravity during culture. According to previous studies, controlled rotation around two axes can minimize the cumulative gravity vector to an average of 10−3× g over time [24]. In our experimental system, although cells were attached to microsphere surfaces, the culture medium containing the microspheres was stirred by controlled rotation around two axes. As a result, the cells’ gravity vectors were randomly and continuously changing, with their final cumulative gravity vectors being minimized toward zero. Some microgravity-simulating devices have been developed [39,40], but they involve significant costs and are very difficult to standardize. Moreover, even such devices created large cell clusters which represent the limit of cell-proliferative capacity [25] and reinforce the advantage of the present adhesive conditions for the large-scale expansion of hASCs [41]. In previous studies, micro-scale carriers fabricated from a variety of natural and synthetic polymers have shown significant potential for cell growth, specific differentiation, and the delivery of hASCs [42,43]. However, to the best of our knowledge, no investigation has been carried out on the feasibility of culturing cells using stirred microspheres for the stated purpose of mimicking a microgravity environment. The outcomes of this study exceeded our expectations. Seven days of polystyrene and collagen microsphere cultures under static conditions produced an increased number of SSEA-3(+) hASCs compared to polystyrene dish cultures, and those under dynamic conditions exhibited a much higher number of SSEA-3(+) hASCs. These results clearly revealed a positive influence of microspheres on the selective proliferation of SSEA-3(+) cells, especially in those experiments combined with a microgravity environment. By comparison, our stress-exposure treatments were not very suitable for the expansion of SSEA-3(+) hASCs. Heneidi et al. reported that Muse cells could be isolated from lipoaspirates using severe cellular stress, such as long-term exposure to collagenase [44]. We also confirmed that exposure to proteolysis produced the best results among our stress conditions, increasing the proportion of SSEA-3(+) hASCs by 3.3-fold (4.2%) compared to monolayer cultures (1.3%). During preliminary studies (unpublished data) to enhance the ratio of SSEA-3(+) hASCs (known to be stress-tolerant [19,32]), stress magnitude was carefully optimized in each experiment. However, because 37.6% of viable cells were lost, the final number of proteolytic solution-treated SSEA-3(+) hASCs was only 1.3-fold more (1.7 × 103) compared to the controls (1.3 × 103), with no statistically significant difference. These results suggest that exposure to severe stress can concentrate SSEA-3(+) hASCs through the selective depletion of SSEA-3(−) cells, but such stress can also inhibit cell proliferation. Instead of concentration, microsphere cultures under microgravity conditions increased SSEA-3(+) hASCs by proliferation (Figure 9). In other words, the present microgravity culture conditions increased not only the proportion, but also the number, of SSEA-3(+) cells to actualize regenerative therapies requiring these highly therapeutic cells. However, a limitation of this study is that we only assessed SSEA-3 as a pluripotent marker in stress-exposure experiments. Additional research including analyses of the other pluripotent markers (e.g., Oct4 and Sox2) may further emphasize the differences between microgravity cultures and stress-exposure cultures, or reveal new characteristics of the two cultures.",

    "link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5587110/",
    "abstract": "The International Space Station (ISS) National Laboratory is dedicated to studying the effects of space on life and physical systems, and to developing new science and technologies for space exploration. A key aspect of achieving these goals is to operate the ISS National Lab more like an Earth-based laboratory, conducting complex end-to-end experimentation, not limited to simple microgravity exposure. Towards that end NASA developed a novel suite of molecular biology laboratory tools, reagents, and methods, named WetLab-2, uniquely designed to operate in microgravity, and to process biological samples for real-time gene expression analysis on-orbit. This includes a novel fluidic RNA Sample Preparation Module and fluid transfer devices, all-in-one lyophilized PCR assays, centrifuge, and a real-time PCR thermal cycler. Here we describe the results from the WetLab-2 validation experiments conducted in microgravity during ISS increment 47/SPX-8. Specifically, quantitative PCR was performed on a concentration series of DNA calibration standards, and Reverse Transcriptase-quantitative PCR was conducted on RNA extracted and purified on-orbit from frozen Escherichia coli and mouse liver tissue. Cycle threshold (Ct) values and PCR efficiencies obtained on-orbit from DNA standards were similar to Earth (1 g) controls. Also, on-orbit multiplex analysis of gene expression from bacterial cells and mammalian tissue RNA samples was successfully conducted in about 3 h, with data transmitted within 2 h of experiment completion. Thermal cycling in microgravity resulted in the trapping of gas bubbles inside septa cap assay tubes, causing small but measurable increases in Ct curve noise and variability. Bubble formation was successfully suppressed in a rapid follow-up on-orbit experiment using standard caps to pressurize PCR tubes and reduce gas release during heating cycles. The WetLab-2 facility now provides a novel operational on-orbit research capability for molecular biology and demonstrates the feasibility of more complex wet bench experiments in the ISS National Lab environment.",
    "introduction": "The ISS National Laboratory is a unique research environment whereby scientists from Academia, Government, and Industry seek to learn the effects of space on life and matter in their many forms. Although a great deal has already been learned about the effects of microgravity on biological systems, [1–3] the large majority of on-orbit experiments do not yield scientific data until long after return of samples to Earth for analysis, creating concerns about timeliness of data availability, and quality of sample preservation [4]. Ground analysis of on-orbit experiments has been necessary because of limited laboratory space, equipment, supplies, and astronaut time resources on ISS, but while this sample return approach maximizes efficient access to space by scientists, it fails to teach us how to conduct end-to-end scientific inquiries in microgravity. As human exploration of the solar system proceeds, human missions to Mars and deep space will require greater levels of autonomy and resourcefulness as outlined in the National Research Council’s Space Exploration Decadal Survey for Life and Physical Sciences [5] An important component of future traveling and living in space away from low Earth orbit will be the ability to perform modern molecular biology analyses, including purifying RNA and conducting Reverse Transcriptase-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) or other genomic analyses for disease diagnostics including viral and bacterial infection, environmental microorganism identification and monitoring of food and water, and in any other research application where monitoring gene expression is required. Although there are increasing numbers of studies of gene expression in microgravity, there are no reports of any methodologies for RNA purification and RT-qPCR under microgravity conditions, effectively preventing on-orbit analysis of gene expression or PCR-based diagnostics from biological samples. Specifically, recent RNA isolation and PCR-based gene expression studies of biological samples on ISS, Space Shuttle and Biosatellites have been conducted on earth after preserved sample return from space [6–14]. Recent efforts by various groups of investigators have sought to develop portions of an overall genomic and molecular biology experimental capability on ISS. Specifically, these include the NASA Genes in Space 1, miniPCR student experiment, [15] and the “Biomolecular Sequencer” Nanopore DNA sequencing demonstration [16, 17] both conducted simultaneously with WetLab-2. Both experiments however, started with genomic DNA samples, not indicative of gene expression, and relied either on sample return to earth for PCR product analysis, (miniPCR), or complex sequencing library preparation on earth prior to nanopore sequencing in space (Biomolecular Sequencer). Neither of these experiments had the end-to-end on-orbit capability to extract RNA from tissue, convert mRNA to cDNA for RT-qPCR, or to generate quantitative gene expression data as we sought to achieve with the WetLab-2 system. To address the pressing ISS research and diagnostics need for novel on-orbit end-to-end molecular biology gene expression analysis methods and tools, we devised a robust microgravity fluidic system that can intake diverse biological sample (cells, tissue, surface swabs, blood, etc.) and using temperature-stable reagents, allow for the isolation and purification of nucleic acids, such as RNA, for molecular biology analysis. In addition, the system includes a microgravity compatible thermal cycler, lyophilized reagents and enzymes for PCR assays and methods for reverse transcription of RNA into cDNA, and capabilities for heat inactivation of enzymes such as proteinase K and PCR inhibitors, plus RT-qPCR gene expression analysis using fluorescent TaqMan probes. The WetLab2 suite of instruments and reagents we describe here is novel and unique methodology, substantially distinct from all other existing RNA isolation and RT-qPCR gene expression analysis systems, because of its ability to function in microgravity, with altered fluid flow, hydrostatic pressure, convection, and surface tension conditions of space, while still providing full reagent containment for safe operation on ISS. Using this system, schematically shown in Fig 1, generic reagents and supplies can be prepositioned on ISS to flexibly support science opportunities such as optimizing plant growth, monitoring the evolution of bacterial communities in biofilms, or analyzing gene expression in immune cells from blood, among many other applications. In addition, the WetLab-2 system was also designed to be capable of purifying RNAs for return to Earth, or for other on-orbit molecular biology analyses such as nanopore array-based mRNA sequencing studies, greatly increasing the analysis capabilities of the system and possibilities for discovery in space.",
    "results": "",
    "conclusion": "One of the major obstacles to space exploration going forward in the coming decades is the fact that microgravity research outposts such as ISS are so closely dependent on Earth support of everyday activities, and lack the ability to operate autonomously. The National Academies of Sciences in their Decadal Survey [5] have identified some of these limitations as important concerns and offered direction that the ISS should operate more like Earth-based laboratories, allowing for experiments to be designed, conducted, modified and iterated in space. Despite the thousands of investigations already conducted on ISS [31], there are still overwhelming limitations [32, 33] that prevent science and specifically molecular biology measurements of gene expression from being conducted and analyzed on-orbit. From its inception, the NASA WetLab-2 project has sought to address these concerns by introducing new, time-efficient, practical and flexible molecular biology gene expression analysis capabilities to the ISS. The WetLab-2 hardware system can now rapidly perform RNA isolation on-orbit and use those RNAs to immediately conduct RT-qPCR analyses, or other novel analyses such as nanopore-based RNA sequencing. The utility of WetLab-2 can be applied to many molecular biology experimental designs using a variety of sample types and provides investigators with improved insight and interactivity during experimentation. Overall, the on-orbit process of total RNA isolation and gene expression analysis is accomplished in a span of approximately 3 h without the requirement for a highly experienced user and provides a new capability to ISS that will greatly expand the limits of possible on-orbit science. Successful development and deployment of the WetLab-2 system to the ISS depended on solving a number of challenges such as limited refrigeration availability, hazardous reagent use allowances, power consumption, and availability of crew time. In addition, the suite of hardware and fluidic components had to function in microgravity and provide ease of use for non-expert operators. In order to perform thermal cycling on-orbit, a suitable, commercially available thermal cycler that was capable of operating in a microgravity environment was identified. Specifically, the Cepheid SmartCycler best met the requirements without significant modifications. The instrument is modular, has reduced power requirements and offers assay wells with individual thermal protocol programming allowing for simultaneous running of assays with different optimal primer annealing temperatures. Validation testing of this instrument included physical durability tests and validation of all 16 sample sites. TaqMan assays were selected because of the ability to multiplex assays with multiple color probes in a single tube, and because alternatives such as SYBRGreen DNA intercalating dyes are carcinogenic, resulting in safety concerns for the ISS crew and imposing elevated containment requirements. Next we developed a RNA isolation and RT-qPCR workflow using non-hazardous reagents suitable for room temperature storage. A RNA binding column and cell lysis system for RNA purification was selected from Claremont BioSolutions for its ease of integration [21, 22]. In collaboration with Claremont, the RNA extraction protocol was modified to meet room temperature storage and low toxicity requirements. RNA extracted from the SPM proved to be of sufficient high quality and quantity for gene expression studies utilizing RT-qPCR (Fig 3B). Longevity testing of loaded SPMs showed no degradation of the reagents for at least 26 weeks (S2 Text). We proceeded to develop a lyophilized all-in-one detection assay to minimize crew time and storage requirements. Lacking instruments to evaluate RNA purity and potential gDNA contamination, intron-spanning primers that give a product approximately 100 bases in length were used in eukaryotic samples. In prokaryotic samples, DNase enzyme [34] was included due to the lack of introns in the coding region [35]. To ensure that lyophilized assays provided similar results to those obtained using wet bench chemistry, we performed extensive validation testing. Our results indicate no significant differences between lyophilized and commercial non-lyophilized assays (see Table 2). When refrigerated, the lyophilized assays were stable with a shelf life of at least 52 weeks (S2 Text). To provide longer shelf life and room temperature storage conditions in the future, we plan to use the standard commercial caps, as they appear to perform better in initial results from ongoing long-term storage tests. Before the WetLab-2 system could be made available to researchers, the system was validated to ensure that the data obtained on-orbit was not affected or biased by microgravity conditions, including surface tension-dominated fluid dynamics and lack of convection [36]. Specifically, because PCR consists of repeated cycles of rapid heating and cooling, lack of gravity-induced convection mixing in microgravity may limit heat transfer throughout the sample to only conduction which may require longer denaturation and annealing/extension times. To validate PCR efficiency in microgravity, control qPCR reactions were conducted once the system was installed on-orbit. These tests included validation with a range of pre-prepared DNA template concentrations (low, mid and high) to assess PCR efficiency. Three replicate runs were conducted, of which two were successful in returning qPCR amplification curves that showed close correlation to 1 g controls. Furthermore, the microgravity Ct results were comparable to their respective 1 g controls (Fig 2 and S1 Table). Although amplification was successful, microgravity data showed increased variability within replicate sets. Analysis of the amplification plots, post-assay tube windows, and follow up experiments suggest that this increased variability may be caused by degassing bubble formation that interferes with fluorescence detection. In subsequent ground-based experiments, we found that these bubbles rise out of the tube detection window under normal 1 g conditions. Conversely, in microgravity, bubbles form, are retained and expand in the tube optical window during thermocycling, creating noise (choppiness) in the resulting amplification curves. Despite higher variability when using septa caps, our data show that qPCR can be conducted in the SmartCycler using TaqMan assays in microgravity conditions, and that resulting Ct values are comparable to those of 1 g controls, albeit noisier (Fig 2G & 2H). These results indicate that the physical alterations of fluid and thermal dynamics in microgravity are not sufficient to alter enzymatic amplification of DNA during PCR thermal cycling in the SmartCycler. To validate that the WetLab-2 system could successfully isolate RNA from intact cells and tissue, as well as perform RT-qPCR analyses on-orbit, we prepared and froze samples of E. coli and mouse liver tissue on the ground. Results show that RNA was successfully isolated on-orbit using the SPM and that singleplex and multiplex RT-qPCR analyses from both E. coli cells and mouse liver tissues resulted in successful qPCR amplification (Fig 3 and S1 Table). Successful multiplex RT-qPCR allows for the use of ratiometric methods; expression of genes of interest can be measured relative to reference genes in the same tube, thereby effectively normalizing variability that may exist in RNA concentrations or other artifacts of microgravity PCR amplification. Comparison of raw background fluorescence data showed significant differences between microgravity and 1 g control samples (S1 File), however, no significant differences in Ct values. In agreement with genomic DNA standards data, increased variability was also observed in the microgravity samples using SPM-derived E. coli and mouse RNA, likely due to bubble formation during thermal cycling. As this variability in Ct values may limit the utility of the system for researchers, a follow up “volunteer science” experiment was conducted by astronaut Kate Rubins. This test was aimed at reducing or eliminating bubbles formed during thermal cycling and showed that the positive pressure formed in the tubes when closed using a standard cap drastically reduces bubbles and results in smooth amplification curves similar to those typically seen during RT-qPCR runs in 1 g (Fig 4). This run yielded data with less variability; standard deviations up to 0.659 Ct for standard caps compared to 1.035 Ct for septa caps. Therefore, for future experiments, we intend to use standard commercial tubes to suppress degassing bubble formation. Through these experiments, we have demonstrated that qPCR can be successfully performed in the microgravity environment of space and developed an system of molecular biology tools and reagents for extracting and quantitatively analyzing RNA from biological samples on-orbit and generating RT-qPCR Ct data (See photos of actual on-orbit operations in Fig 5).",

    "title": "Spaceflight Modulates the Expression of Key Oxidative Stress and Cell Cycle Related Genes in Heart",
    "link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8396460/",
    "abstract": "Spaceflight causes cardiovascular changes due to microgravity-induced redistribution of body fluids and musculoskeletal unloading. Cardiac deconditioning and atrophy on Earth are associated with altered Trp53 and oxidative stress-related pathways, but the effects of spaceflight on cardiac changes at the molecular level are less understood. We tested the hypothesis that spaceflight alters the expression of key genes related to stress response pathways, which may contribute to cardiovascular deconditioning during extended spaceflight. Mice were exposed to spaceflight for 15 days or maintained on Earth (ground control). Ventricle tissue was harvested starting ~3 h post-landing. We measured expression of select genes implicated in oxidative stress pathways and Trp53 signaling by quantitative PCR. Cardiac expression levels of 37 of 168 genes tested were altered after spaceflight. Spaceflight downregulated transcription factor, Nfe2l2 (Nrf2), upregulated Nox1 and downregulated Ptgs2, suggesting a persistent increase in oxidative stress-related target genes. Spaceflight also substantially upregulated Cdkn1a (p21) and cell cycle/apoptosis-related gene Myc, and downregulated the inflammatory response gene Tnf. There were no changes in apoptosis-related genes such as Trp53. Spaceflight altered the expression of genes regulating redox balance, cell cycle and senescence in cardiac tissue of mice. Thus, spaceflight may contribute to cardiac dysfunction due to oxidative stress.",
    "introduction": "Responses to spaceflight include cardiovascular deficits, loss of bone and muscle mass, compromised immune function, chromosomal aberrations and metabolic changes [1,2,3]. With future lunar and interplanetary space missions, astronauts will stay in space for longer periods, presenting increased cardiovascular risk to the crew. Therefore, a better understanding of molecular mechanisms that mediate physiological responses to the space environment is needed. Entering into microgravity causes a cephalad shift of body fluids which leads to increased heart stroke volume, a rise in left ventricular end diastolic dimensions and a fluid shift between the vasculature and interstitium [4,5,6]. The fluid shift invokes compensatory endocrine and renal mechanisms [6]. These alterations can diminish the capability of the heart to cope with gravitational stress immediately after returning to Earth, leading to orthostatic intolerance, as previously documented in some astronauts [7]. Gravitational unloading in space also contributes to cardiovascular deconditioning [8], despite vigorous on-orbit exercise programs implemented on the International Space Station (ISS). Both spaceflight and head-down-tilt bed rest, a ground-based model for human spaceflight, can cause reduced plasma volume and left ventricular atrophy [9,10]. A reduction in myocardial interstitial fluid may contribute to lower myocardial mass following microgravity exposure [11]. In rodents, 14 days of spaceflight was reported to reduce cardiac myocyte size relative to ground controls, which is consistent with cardiac atrophy [12]. In contrast, spaceflight for one week did not affect cardiac mass [13], although it is possible that this period is too short to cause demonstrable cardiac atrophy. Hindlimb unloading (HU), a ground-based rodent model for simulating weightlessness, is reported to cause cardiac atrophy in some studies [14,15], but not in others [13], thus further work in this area is needed. In addition to gravitational unloading, long term habitation in space will expose astronauts to low doses of ionizing radiation, which may contribute to both cardiac and vascular changes in oxidative pathways leading to tissue dysfunction [16,17,18]. In fact, spaceflight can cause substantial changes in expression of genes and biomarkers related to metabolic and oxidative stress pathways in various tissues of both astronauts and animals [19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27]. The relative contributions of the various complex factors of habitation in space, including microgravity and ionizing radiation, to observed changes in oxidative stress-related pathways are not yet understood. Activation of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis signal transduction pathways are major stress responses important for defending against many physiological and environmental challenges, including tissue oxidative stress. Spaceflight can alter expression of various cell cycle arrest and apoptosis regulatory genes [28,29] including CDKN1A (also known as P21), a cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor that mediates cell cycle arrest via cyclin interactions and apoptosis via TRP53. In addition, CDKN1A/P21 is a negative regulator of tissue regeneration in mammals, and is known to interact with NFE2L2 (aka NRF2), a master transcriptional regulator of oxidative defense genes. Spaceflight elevates Cdkn1a expression in bone tissue [30], liver and kidney [31] as well as cultured cells [29], implicating activation of CDKN1A as a pathway invoked in multiple tissues in response to the space environment. We hypothesized that spaceflight leads to activation of oxidative stress and cell cycle/apoptosis-related pathways in the heart. To begin to test this hypothesis, we used thematic PCR arrays to identify the changes in expression levels of genes related to oxidative stress and cell cycle/apoptosis (Trp53) signal transduction pathways in mice exposed to 15 days of spaceflight on the STS-131 space shuttle mission. Our gene expression findings in heart are novel and consistent with activation of several molecular pathways, including those related to oxidative stress, cell cycle regulation, inflammation and DNA damage repair, which ultimately may contribute to cardiac dysfunction during long duration spaceflight.",
    "results": "",
    "conclusion": "Our findings provide new insight into how the heart responds at the molecular level to the novel environment of space. Spaceflight experiments using rodents present unique practical challenges though similar benefits to rodent studies on Earth. The animals flown in space during this particular mission were deemed healthy, as assessed by veterinary examination after return to Earth, and the finding that animal body weights were comparable in FLT mice compared to GRD controls at the termination of the study. Further, numerous scientific reports from these mice describe related results obtained studying other organ systems (e.g., [30,32,33]). The RNA samples recovered from the hearts were consistent and of high quality. Therefore, we conclude that the results we obtained from this mission were valid. Whereas cardiovascular physiology has been studied intensively in astronauts, analysis of cardiac changes at the tissue level has been more limited [12,13,34,35,36]. Goldstein et al. [12] report that spaceflight (14 days) reduces the cross-sectional area of papillary cardiomyocytes in rats relative to ground controls, with ultrastructural changes consistent with cardiac atrophy. Short duration (6 days) spaceflight upregulates activity and mRNA expression of the mitochondrial enzyme, malate dehydrogenase in rat hearts, and displays a pattern of mitochondrial gene expression changes discrete from those in skeletal muscle [34]. More recently, long duration spaceflight (37 days) was shown to alter expression of methylation-related genes in the heart of adult mice, but not cytoskeletal protein levels. Interestingly, lifetime exposure of Drosophila to microgravity leads to diminished cardiac size, cardiac dysfunction, altered remodeling, and proteosomal abnormalities [36]. Furthermore, spaceflight causes cardiac progenitor cells in culture to display a gene expression profile consistent with early, stem-like function along with increased oxidative stress and re-entry into the cell cycle [37]. Thus, our study on expression levels of oxidative stress and cell cycle-related genes provides novel findings on how the heart responds to spaceflight at the tissue level.",

    "link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5666799/",
    "abstract": "Space radiation may pose a risk to skeletal health during subsequent aging. Irradiation acutely stimulates bone remodeling in mice, although the long-term influence of space radiation on bone-forming potential (osteoblastogenesis) and possible adaptive mechanisms are not well understood. We hypothesized that ionizing radiation impairs osteoblastogenesis in an ion-type specific manner, with low doses capable of modulating expression of redox-related genes. 16-weeks old, male, C57BL6/J mice were exposed to low linear-energy-transfer (LET) protons (150 MeV/n) or high-LET 56Fe ions (600 MeV/n) using either low (5 or 10 cGy) or high (50 or 200 cGy) doses at NASA’s Space Radiation Lab. Five weeks or one year after irradiation, tissues were harvested and analyzed by microcomputed tomography for cancellous microarchitecture and cortical geometry. Marrow-derived, adherent cells were grown under osteoblastogenic culture conditions. Cell lysates were analyzed by RT-PCR during the proliferative or mineralizing phase of growth, and differentiation was analyzed by imaging mineralized nodules. As expected, a high dose (200 cGy), but not lower doses, of either 56Fe or protons caused a loss of cancellous bone volume/total volume. Marrow cells produced mineralized nodules ex vivo regardless of radiation type or dose; 56Fe (200 cGy) inhibited osteoblastogenesis by more than 90% (5 weeks and 1 year post-IR). After 5 weeks, irradiation (protons or 56Fe) caused few changes in gene expression levels during osteoblastogenesis, although a high dose 56Fe (200 cGy) increased Catalase and Gadd45. The addition of exogenous superoxide dismutase (SOD) protected marrow-derived osteoprogenitors from the damaging effects of exposure to low-LET (137Cs γ) when irradiated in vitro, but had limited protective effects on high-LET 56Fe-exposed cells. In sum, either protons or 56Fe at a relatively high dose (200 cGy) caused persistent bone loss, whereas only high-LET 56Fe increased redox-related gene expression, albeit to a limited extent, and inhibited osteoblastogenesis. Doses below 50 cGy did not elicit widespread responses in any parameter measured. We conclude that high-LET irradiation at 200 cGy impaired osteoblastogenesis and regulated steady-state gene expression of select redox-related genes during osteoblastogenesis, which may contribute to persistent bone loss.",
    "introduction": "Structural degradation and oxidative stress following exposure to space radiation potentially endangers skeletal health of astronauts, both during the mission and later in life. Weightlessness-induced musculoskeletal atrophy, psychological stress, and confinement pose additional risks to astronaut health [1]. For exploration missions into deep space, galactic cosmic-rays (GCR) are of particular concern because of the high-energy and densely ionizing pattern of energy deposition from heavy ions [2,3,4], which can induce oxidative stress [5,6] in various tissues. Both solar particle-emissions (SPE) and GCR contribute to the mixed composition of low-energy radiation (such as protons and γ rays), high linear-energy-transfer (LET) particles (such as ionized 56Fe- and 12C-nuclei), and secondary constituents, such as Bremmstrahlung, fragmentation products, and neutrons [4,7]. Estimates of the total absorbed dose during a Mars mission (180-day transits with 500-day surface operations) to be between 28–47 cGy, with GCR contributing 27 cGy [8,9]. Currently, risk of exposure-induced death from a fatal cancer drives the NASA astronaut career radiation-exposure limit [10], though NASA is investigating additional risks associated with acute and late tissue degeneration following radiation exposure [11]. Irradiation perturbs the redox balance within the bone and marrow compartment in a complex and transient manner. Total-body irradiation (137Cs, 200 cGy) induces rapid reactive oxidative species formation in the marrow [12] and increases expression of the master transcription factor that binds to the antioxidant response element, nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2) [13]. Excess reactive oxygen species (ROS) can interfere with osteogenesis of bone marrow derived osteoprogenitors [14,15] as well as contribute to bone resorption by osteoclasts [16]. High-LET 56Fe (≥200 cGy) impairs cell proliferation during osteoblastogenesis from marrow progenitors in a dose-dependent manner [17]. Further, irradiation in vitro with 56Fe (100 cGy) arrests the cell cycle and inhibits proliferation of mesenchymal stem cells [18]. At higher doses (400–800 cGy), irradiation with X-rays increases ROS, depletes antioxidant stores, increases Nrf2 protein levels, and reduces differentiation in osteoblast-like cells [19]. However, the role of oxidative stress on the potential for total-body irradiation (TBI) to impair osteoblastogenesis over the long term, in particular low-dose, high-LET species, has not been fully characterized. We posed three principal questions to address in this study. First, are the severity of acute bone loss [12,13,20,21] and impairment of osteoblastogenesis [17] following TBI dependent on radiation type (LET) or dose? Secondly, which pathways are activated? Finally, do irradiation-induced insults to skeletal structure and osteoblastogenesis persist long after exposure? We hypothesized that: (1) irradiation induces bone loss, shown previously to be dominated by total dose of exposure [22], and leads to temporal perturbations in antioxidant defenses; (2) TBI induces both persistent changes in redox-related genes and cancellous microarchitecture in an ion-dependent manner; and, (3) addition of an antioxidant, here the enzyme superoxide dismutase (SOD), mitigates irradiation-induced damage to osteoprogenitors and stem cells when exposed in vitro, implicating an oxidative-stress dependent mechanism. To address these questions, we conducted in vivo and in vitro experiments. For in vivo work, we selected protons and 56Fe ions as representative radiation for the abundant low-LET particles in space radiation and the heavy-ion component of galactic cosmic radiation, respectively. For in vitro work, we selected 137Cs γ rays as a low-LET reference radiation to enable high-throughput countermeasure testing. In vivo, there were persistent and profound decrements in mineralized nodules after TBI (at 200 cGy) with 56Fe, while protons had a milder effect. In contrast to our hypothesis, few changes were observed in the steady-state expression of redox-related genes during ex vivo osteoblastogenesis following TBI, although there was some indication of altered expression of select genes during the proliferative phase (at 200 cGy 56Fe, but not lower doses). Furthermore, scavenging ROS with an antioxidant (i.e., SOD) mitigated adverse effects of in vitro irradiation with γ rays, but failed to protect fully from irradiation with an equivalent dose of heavy ions.",

    "conclusion": "Heavy-ion irradiation during space missions is a risk to the skeletal health of astronauts, causing skeletal degeneration and cellular damage in simulations with rodents [12,20,24]. In this study, we sought to elucidate the role of radiation type and changes in the oxidative milieu of bone marrow related to marrow-derived osteoprogenitor differentiation. We found that low doses (below 50 cGy) of either low-LET protons or high-LET 56Fe did not cause observable adverse effects on structure and osteoblastogenesis at any endpoint, and, further, did not strongly perturb antioxidant capacity at seven days of exposure (Figure 6) nor expression levels of redox-related genes (Figure 4, Table 2) at 35 days of exposure. In contrast, only a high dose of 56Fe radiation (200 cGy) was sufficient to induce detrimental effects on total antioxidant capacity, bone structure, and osteoprogenitor populations of the marrow (Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5 and Figure 6). These changes were associated with transient elevations in mRNA levels (Figure 4C,D) of an antioxidant gene (Catalase) and a DNA-damage/cell cycle arrest marker (Gadd45) during ex vivo osteoblastogenesis, which we speculate indicates persistent oxidative stress or enhanced antioxidant defenses during the proliferative phase. Interestingly, cultures showed a trend towards elevation of osteocalcin (Bglap, Figure 4D), a late marker of differentiation, during the proliferative phase, which may indicate that 56Fe exposure accelerated differentiation. Body mass and coat color were assessed as general indices of animal health. Body mass indicated that animals showed a modest and transient decline in response to 56Fe irradiation with 200 cGy (Figure 2), consistent with our previous studies [17]. Additionally, 56Fe irradiation at 200 cGy uniquely caused a shift in coat color from black to grey (Table 1). We interpret this as a hallmark of oxidative stress in the hair follicle [25], and, when coupled with the osteoprogenitor effects, this may signal premature aging in a second tissue, in line with the free-radical theory of cellular aging [26,27]. In rodents, radiation injury to bone between with 56Fe (10–200 cGy, 1 GeV/n) [17] manifests as acute cell death of marrow cells and concomitant cancellous bone loss driven by osteoclasts [12,22,28]. In this work, we showed that high-dose 56Fe or proton (200 cGy) caused a transient reduction in antioxidant capacity in the marrow microenvironment (Figure 6), potentially indicative of a depletion of extracellular antioxidant stores with subsequent recovery of the extracellular antioxidant defense system [29]. These findings are consistent with our data showing the marrow cell response to increase mRNA expression levels of the master antioxidant transcription factor, Nrf2, shown previously [13], and with effects also evident in a cell line at even higher doses [19]. Our group showed that a dietary supplement rich in antioxidants and polyphenols (dried plum) prevents bone loss and Nrf2 induction from γ irradiation in mice [30], supportive of the role of oxidative stress in driving acute bone loss. Additionally, in vitro, 200 cGy 56Fe impairs osteoblastogenesis [17]. Our work extends this high-dose impairment in vivo and to five weeks and one year post-exposure, suggesting an irreversible insult to osteoblastogenesis. Gene expression analyses during the proliferative phase (Figure 4D) revealed that a high dose of 56Fe (200 cGy) increased the expression of genes for the cell cycle arrest marker Gadd45 and antioxidant Catalase relative to sham. These data are consistent with a G2/M arrest from high-LET irradiation of mesenchymal stem cells [18], a pre-osteoblast cell line [31], and many other cell types [32]. Interestingly, these two genes are targets of Foxo transcription factors [33,34,35]. Nrf2, Foxos, and p21 are critical to the antioxidant response element [36]. Oxidative stress activates Foxo transcription factors [37] and interferes with Wnt signaling [14,38,39,40]. Hence, our data suggest Foxo activation may play a role in 56Fe irradiation, decreasing osteoprogenitor cell proliferation, and, ultimately, mineralization levels. During the mineralization phase (Figure 4A,B), 56Fe irradiation (200 cGy) tended to reduce nodule formation and alkaline phosphatase gene expression, suggesting a reduction in early markers of early-stage osteoblast differentiation and fewer cells contributing to nodule formation, consistent with in vitro evidence for high-dose effects [19]. Taken together with gene expression data, these findings suggest that irradiation induced persistent oxidative stress that impaired colony formation via reduced proliferation (e.g., delayed or halted cell division) leading to lower extent of mineralization. Higher doses of γ irradiation (>500 cGy) are required to recapitulate the impairment of osteoblastogenesis [41,42], where changes are also associated with oxidative damage [43]. Taking these findings into consideration, the sequelae of a high-dose of heavy-ion irradiation are likely impaired osteoblastogenesis, which may be attributable to persistent oxidative stress. For evaluating structural responses, we analyzed cancellous regions in the tibia (Figure 3) and the cortical midshaft of the femur (Table 1) at two time points for parameters indicative of structural integrity. At 5-weeks after irradiation, exposure to high-LET 56Fe irradiation at or above 50 cGy caused decrements in fractional bone volume and trabecular number, and increases in trabecular spacing (Figure 3), indicating a significant deterioration of cancellous microarchitecture, consistent with previous findings [20,22,44]. The magnitude of the changes caused by protons or 56Fe were similar, although the effect of protons at 50 cGy on BV/TV was not statistically significant (p = 0.12). Thus, these findings indicate that the threshold for a persistent, 56Fe radiation-induced response lies between 10 and 50 cGy—doses relevant to exploration missions [11]. Overall, we show that a high dose of radiation was able to induce persistent decrements in cancellous bone, regardless of radiation type (Figure 3). Others have shown that these changes persist to four months post-exposure [22]. In this study, the structural decrement affected by 56Fe (200 cGy) was resolved one year after exposure due to the expected age-related decline in sham-control animals changes over time (Table 1), likely the product of age-induced elevations of osteoclasts overtaking waning bone formation by osteoblasts [45]. These data are consistent with our previous findings from growing female mice after exposure to low-LET γ radiation [46]. Although others have shown cortical changes following irradiation with either low-LET γ at high doses (500 cGy) [47] or high-LET 56Fe at 50 cGy [48], no irradiation-induced cortical responses at 1-year post exposure were evident in this study [23], or in other experiments we have performed in the past. Thus, the influence of ionizing radiation at 200 cGy or below appears to be restricted to the more metabolically-active cancellous tissue. In vitro irradiation studies were conducted to further assess the role of oxidative stress in radiation damage to osteoprogenitors. Our approach was to test antioxidants and their capacity to rescue radiation effects to provide insight into the different mechanisms between low-LET radiation and high-LET radiation [31]. Although similar doses of low-LET radiation are generally less deleterious than high-LET radiation, the mechanisms for radiation damage to primary, marrow-derived osteoprogenitors in the context of oxidative stress are not fully elucidated [49,50,51]. When comparing the effects of low-LET radiation (137Cs) and high-LET radiation (56Fe), we found high-LET irradiation was more damaging with respect to growth of the cell population, as assessed by a surrogate assay (changes in DNA content over time). Furthermore, exogenous SOD effectively protected osteoprogenitors from low-LET radiation damage, but only minimally from 56Fe at 100 cGy, and not at all from 56Fe at 200 cGy. Taken together, these findings indicate excess extracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) inhibited growth, and that oxidative stress is possibly the main mechanism involved in low-LET radiodamage to osteoprogenitors; in contrast, high-LET species likely affect the cells via additional detrimental mechanisms, such as double-strand DNA breaks. Although others [52,53] have shown the beneficial effects of various antioxidants to confer radioprotection for various osteoblast cell lines, we show here a direct comparison of antioxidant treatment with different radiation species when added to primary, marrow-derived osteoprogenitors. Interestingly, adding SOD at higher doses or for longer periods was not advantageous, emphasizing the importance of carefully titrating radical scavengers such as SOD, possibly to maintain endogenous ROS-dependent signalling. In sum, we showed the ability of the antioxidant superoxide dismutase (SOD) to mitigate the adverse effects of in vitro irradiation with γ rays (used for the low-LET radiation), but not to an equivalent dose of high-LET 56Fe. Our results strengthen the potential application of SOD as a countermeasure for low-LET irradiation-induced damage to marrow stem cells and osteoprogenitors. Inherent limitations of these experiments with respect to radiation exposures include: (1) exposures were delivered at high dose-rate and fluence in a matter of minutes, whereas in space, the same dose is delivered at a lower rate, and (2) space exposures are mixed doses, rather than a single species (e.g., SPE can deliver 100–200 cGy over days and GCR over years). In addition, with respect to relevance to spaceflight, these experiments were performed in mice that were normally ambulatory, thus not subjected to musculoskeletal disuse and fluid shifts, which are induced by microgravity; groundbased models for spaceflight have shown that unloading can influence radiosensitivity [17,24,54,55]. In summary, our findings indicate that although low doses of radiation do not show lasting effects on skeletal health, a high dose of high-LET 56Fe impairs osteoblast growth and maturation by adversely affecting growth of osteoprogenitors. There were few, select changes in steady-state expression of redox-related genes during osteoblastogenesis ex vivo after total body irradiation with 56Fe (but not protons), with some indication of altered expression of select genes during the proliferative phase. Furthermore, scavenging ROS with antioxidants, such as SOD, mitigated the adverse effects of in vitro irradiation with γ rays (200 cGy), but failed to protect from irradiation with an equivalent dose of heavy ions. Together, our findings indicate that high-dose radiation has a persistent effect to impair bone formation by adversely affecting growth, but not differentiation, of osteoprogenitors.",

    "introduction": "With the International Space Station (ISS) available for research and habitation for the next decade, there is now a precious opportunity to significantly advance the contributions of space life sciences and space medicine toward enabling the Exploration Class missions (that is, human missions beyond low-Earth orbit). Such missions are currently burdened with significant anticipated crew health and safety challenges.1 Coordinated research and development are crucial for producing effective countermeasures against the deleterious influences of spaceflight on the human body. To this end, we emphatically support the development of translational research efforts at NASA that will facilitate bi-directional information flow between basic and applied life sciences and medical operations with the goal to accelerate countermeasure development. As identified by National Academy committees and embedded in the NASA Strategic Plan, a sustainable human spaceflight program requires robust research at both basic and applied levels to make fundamental biological discoveries and to address the known and emerging risks to human health resulting from the spaceflight environment, respectively.2–5 The Life Sciences portfolio at NASA is composed of the Space Biology program (a basic science program), the Human Research Program (HRP, an applied program), and Medical Operations (Office of Chief Health and Medical Officer). Informal translational research within these programs has taken place at NASA for decades, yet there is a need for a more coordinated effort that enables dynamic translation that can take rapid advantage of new findings. In particular, the National Academy committees recommended that NASA follows key elements of the National Institutes of Health’s (NIH) model of translational science.6,7 It was specifically recommended that the coordination and maturation of projects between each level of research be enhanced to increase knowledge transfer and identification of potential solutions for astronaut health challenges.2–4 Additionally, the translation of knowledge to Earth-based medical care has recently begun with the designation of the ISS as a National Laboratory (currently through the Center for the Advancement of Science in Space). In this paper, we provide context for the current drivers (and needs) for translational research at NASA, briefly summarize the experience at NIH, and lay out a two-phased approach for translational research. As illustrated in Fig. 1, the first phase is basic-to-applied and the second phase is applied-to-operational. We define the levels of the research continuum as follows, consistent with the Decadal Survey’s Interim Report:5 basic research aims to generate new biological knowledge using biological systems or model organisms, applied research aims to develop countermeasures for risks to astronaut health (similar to pre-clinical research), and medical operations puts countermeasures into practice for astronauts (like operations in the clinic).",

    "title": "High-precision method for cyclic loading of small-animal vertebrae to assess bone quality.",
    "link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6222041/",
    "abstract": "One potentially important bone quality characteristic is the response of bone to cyclic (repetitive) mechanical loading. In small animals, such as in rats and mice, cyclic loading experiments are particularly challenging to perform in a precise manner due to the small size of the bones and difficult-to-eliminate machine compliance. Addressing this issue, we developed a precise method for ex vivo cyclic compressive loading of isolated mouse vertebral bodies. The method has three key characteristics: 3D-printed support jigs for machining plano-parallel surfaces of the tiny vertebrae; pivotable loading platens to ensure uniform contact and loading of specimen surfaces; and specimen-specific micro-CT-based finite element analysis to measure stiffness to prescribe force levels that produce the same specified level of strain for all test specimens. To demonstrate utility, we measured fatigue life for three groups (n = 5–6 per group) of L5 vertebrae of C57BL/6J male mice, comparing our new method against two methods commonly used in the literature. We found reduced scatter of the mechanical behavior for this new method compared to the literature methods. In particular, for a controlled level of strain, the standard deviation of the measured fatigue life was up to 5-fold lower for the new method (F-ratio = 4.9; p < 0.01). The improved precision for this new method for biomechanical testing of small-animal vertebrae may help elucidate aspects of bone quality.",
    "introduction": "A number of diseases, including osteoporosis (Bouxsein, 2003a; Saito and Marumo, 2010) and type II diabetes (Janghorbani et al., 2007; Vestergaard, 2007; Farr and Khosla, 2016; Rubin and Patsch, 2016), are thought to increase fracture risk due in part to deteriorated bone quality. That is, these diseases may result in detrimental changes to mechanical behavior that are not directly associated with reductions in bone mass (Hernandez and Keaveny, 2006). Concerns over possible changes in bone quality have also caused the FDA to require extensive pre-clinical animal testing on any new treatments (Mosekilde, 1995; Ominsky et al., 2011). In assessing bone quality, various mechanical properties can be measured (Hernandez and Keaveny, 2006; Turner and Burr, 1993; Fyhrie and Christiansen, 2015), typically stiffness, strength, toughness, and ductility. All these properties are obtained from monotonic loading. In addition, the response of bone to cyclic (repetitive) loading may be important for bone quality assessment if such loading produces unique failure mechanisms (e.g. slow crack growth, microdamage accumulation) that are not manifested in monotonic loading (Kruzic and Ritchie, 2008; Nalla et al., 2003). Biomechanical testing of any type is challenging to perform in a precise manner in small animals, such as in rats and mice, due to the small size of the bones and the inevitable machine-compliance effects that are difficult to eliminate. Furthermore, for cyclic loading, loss of test specimens during the experiment and the substantial variation in cyclic-loading responses both serve to reduce statistical power (Brouwers et al., 2009), which in turn can lead to inconclusive findings regarding the role of bone quality. As a result of these challenges, and because of the continuing interest in bone quality (Bouxsein, 2003b; Seeman and Delmas, 2006), there remains a need to refine the experimental protocols for biomechanical testing of small-animal bone specimens, particularly for cyclic loading. Here, we report on a method for cyclic biomechanical testing of the mouse lumbar vertebra ex vivo that has improved precision. This technique should help optimize statistical power in animal experiments, thus improving the ability of researchers to detect mechanically relevant changes in bone quality due to aging, disease, or treatment, particularly for any situation in which samples sizes are limited in number.",
    "results": "Of all three methods tested, the new (KFEA) method produced the lowest variation in fatigue life. The mean value of the applied force was the same for all groups (22 N), but the standard deviation was lowest for the new (KFEA) method (±0.77 N), 8-fold and 7-fold lower than the KEXP and FMAX methods (F-ratio = 5.5; p < 0.01; Fig. 5A), respectively. Because of these larger variations in applied force for the literature methods, the fatigue life displayed a negative S-N type relation with the loading force (R2 = 0.73 both literature methods) but there was no such correlation for the new method (R2 = 0.07; Fig. 6). Instead, for the new method the fatigue life was approximately uniform across all specimens (5.0 ± 0.2), and its standard deviation was 5-fold and 2-fold lower than for the KEXP or FMAX methods, respectively (F-ratio = 4.9; p = 0.008; Fig. 5A).",
    "conclusion": "Our new method for cyclic loading of small-animal vertebrae yielded highly reproducible measurements of fatigue life and was successful, in part, by effectively controlling for the nominal level of strain applied to these tiny bone specimens. Failure of bone in both static and fatigue loading is largely thought to be strain-controlled (Nalla et al., 2003; Bowman et al., 1998; Keaveny et al., 2001; Keaveny et al., 1994c; Schileo et al., 2008). To apply a repeatable initial strain to each specimen, a consistent measurement of stiffness must first be obtained. Our new method utilized specimen-specific micro-CT-based finite element analyses to measure specimen stiffness and prescribe an individualized cyclic force for each specimen. In turn, these individualized forces resulted in a consistent starting level of strain applied to all test specimens, and resulted in similar values of fatigue life. By contrast, our implementations of the two literature methods were unable to consistently apply the specified starting strain value, which produced more scatter in the magnitude of the applied forces and an unintended S-N-like relationship. The reduced level of scatter in fatigue life using this method would be particularly helpful for studies limited to a small sample size, such as in vivo animal experiments, to improve detection in cyclic properties. The consistency of our strain-to-failure results with those from other studies supports the validity of our new approach. While the fatigue life will depend on the level of loading, strain-to-failure is emerging as a more uniform outcome across many different cyclic loading experiments. Our strain-to-failure (mean ± SD) value of 3.20 ± 0.80%, from cyclic compression testing of mouse vertebrae, is consistent with cyclic compression results for other species: 3.36 ± 2.13% for human trabecular bone (Haddock et al., 2004), 2.85% ± 0.66% for bovine trabecular bone (Bowman et al., 1998), and 4.19 ± 1.52% for rat whole-bone vertebra (Brouwers et al., 2009). A similar value in cyclic compressive strain-to-failure between these studies and ours might be expected for two reasons. First, the bone material, primarily the collagen component which dominates the plasticity and therefore strain-to-failure of the bone (Burstein et al., 1975), is similar amongst the species listed. And second, others have reported on relatively uniform values for the strain-to-failure independent of apparent density, applied loads, or temperature (Bowman et al., 1998; Keaveny et al., 2001; Keaveny et al., 1994c). While the absolute value of strain to failure will be influenced by any machine compliance, the general level of agreement and small degree of scatter suggests that bone tissue does indeed fail at a narrow range of strain under cyclic loading, and that our protocol was successful in reducing the variation in strain across different specimens. Our findings also indicate that implementing a pivotable loading platen to ensure uniform contact is important for accuracy of results, at least for these small-animal bones. We observed a reduced Kelastic and fatigue life for the KEXP method compared to the new method, even though the specimens used in both protocols had similar size and microarchitecture (Appendix B; Table 1). We attribute these inconsistent results to the rigid platen design used in the KEXP method testing. Even with rigorous specimen preparation in place, we found that perfectly plano-parallel loading surfaces on small bones cannot always be achieved. And without an adjustable platen, the load can be localized to an area that comes into contact with the platen first, producing an effective stress concentration. This localized load can result in reduced stiffness and the stress concentration in reduced fatigue life. There are some limitations to this study. First, the bone tissue used in this study was shared tissue, which did not allow for random assignment of animals across all groups, and thus it is possible specimens differed across groups. However, the similarity in size and structure of specimen across all groups as per micro-CT analysis (Appendix B; Table 1) suggests the only source of appreciable heterogeneity could be in tissue material properties, which is unlikely because the animals were of the same strain, sex, and approximate age. Second, the initial strain values of (εmax = 0.5%) used for our new method may be specific to this particular protocol, which assumed an effective tissue modulus of 10 GPa in the finite element analyses. The assumed value was chosen empirically by trial and error on some preliminary test specimens, such that the resulting Fmax values were approximately half of the directly measured ultimate force. To use this method in other animal models, large or small (e.g. rat, bovine, monkey), similar preliminary testing to determine the value of εmax is suggested, particularly if it is suspected that the effective tissue modulus might differ from mouse vertebrae. We recommend using an elastic strain level that is associated with about half of the ultimate strength. Third, the values of the effective tissue elastic modulus reported here are specific to this experiment. Parameters such as temperature, loading frequency, and use of different platens, can all contribute to machine compliance and variation between tests, thus the effective tissue modulus should not be considered a true material property. Placing an extensometer across the platens directly beside the specimen ends can minimize machine compliance effects. However, it is best to use the effective tissue modulus as a relative measurement to compare between untreated and treated specimens within an experiment, but not across studies (e.g. between mouse and rat bones). Lastly, as with any laboratory-based biomechanical testing, the loading configuration does not mimic exact in vivo conditions. Our removal of the endplate and loading via a rigid platen versus loading via intact disc and endplate is a clear limitation. Thus, while our results do not describe expected in vivo behavior, our protocol does produce highly repeatable results, which should help elucidate changes in bone quality characteristics by aging, disease, or treatment. The main application of our new method is to provide greater statistical power in using small-animal experiments to mechanically assess relevant aspects of bone quality associated with aging, disease, or treatment. A small sample size and scatter associated with the fatigue testing present challenges for detecting statistically significant effects unless those effects are large. For example, Brouwers et al. (Brouwers et al., 2009) found a 37.5% difference in steady-state creep rate and 15.7% difference in loss of stiffness with zoledronate treatment in an osteoporotic rat model, but could not report a detectable significance due to high variation in the data and loss of some samples. Our KEXP method was similar to their method, which produced standard deviations in fatigue life (reported as “time-to-failure”) up to the same magnitude as the mean value. Our new method should reduce that range up to 8-fold. Furthermore, unlike in the Brouwers literature protocol, we had no loss of specimens, enabled by repeatable specimen preparation (e.g. 3D-printed support jigs for machining plano-parallel surfaces) and uniform loading of specimen surfaces (e.g. spherically-seated platen), which further improves statistical power, and can be implemented for monotonic testing or fatigue testing of small-animal vertebrae. That said, our new method is a time intensive process for specimen preparation, micro-CT, image processing, and finite element analysis. However, the extra effort improves the ability to detect small differences across treatment groups without using a large number of animals, which is advantageous both ethically and also logistically when sample sizes are inherently limited (e.g. space flight experiments). Thus, use of our new method may improve the ability of future studies to elucidate mechanically relevant aspects of bone quality associated with aging, disease, or treatment.

    "title": "Effects of ex vivo ionizing radiation on collagen structure and whole-bone mechanical properties of mouse vertebrae.",
    "link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6813909/",
    "abstract": "Bone can become brittle when exposed to ionizing radiation across a wide range of clinically relevant doses that span from radiotherapy (accumulative 50 Gy) to sterilization (~35,000 Gy). While irradiation-induced embrittlement has been attributed to changes in the collagen molecular structure, the relative role of collagen fragmentation versus non-enzymatic collagen crosslinking remains unclear. To better understand the effects of radiation on the bone material without cellular activity, we conducted an ex vivo x-ray radiation experiment on excised mouse lumbar vertebrae. Spinal tissue from twenty-week old, female, C57BL/6J mice were randomly assigned to a single x-ray radiation dose of either 0 (control), 50, 1,000, 17,000, or 35,000 Gy. Measurements were made for collagen fragmentation, non-enzymatic collagen crosslinking, and both monotonic and cyclic-loading compressive mechanical properties. We found that the group differences for mechanical properties were more consistent with those for collagen fragmentation than for non-enzymatic collagen crosslinking. Monotonic strength at 17,000 and 35,000 Gy was lower than that of the control by 50% and 73% respectively, (p < 0.001) but at 50 and 1,000 Gy was not different than the control. Consistent with those trends, collagen fragmentation only occurred at 17,000 and 35,000 Gy. By contrast, non-enzymatic collagen crosslinking was greater than control for all radiation doses (p < 0.001). All results were consistent both for monotonic and cyclic loading conditions. We conclude that the reductions in bone compressive monotonic strength and fatigue life due to ex vivo ionizing radiation are more likely caused by fragmentation of the collagen backbone than any increases in non-enzymatic collagen crosslinks.",
    "introduction": "For a variety of clinical applications, bones are exposed to a wide range of ionizing radiation doses. In vivo, radiotherapy treatment results in an accumulated localized dose of ~50 Gy1 in cancer patients [1–3]. Ex vivo, bone allografts are sterilized at a dose of 30,000 ± 5,000 Gy [4,5]. While these high-dose applications are critical for overall patient health and safety, high levels of ionizing radiation exposure have been shown to increase risk of fracture [6,7]. For example, for women with anal, rectal or colon cancer, those treated with radiation therapy were more than three times as likely to suffer a pelvic fracture than those without radiation therapy [8]. Furthermore, for patients with implanted bone allografts, allografts sterilized with radiation were twice as likely to fail compared to allografts sterilized using other methods [9]. The increased risk of fracture clinically has led to research into the effect of high levels of ionizing radiation exposure on the mechanical and biochemical properties of bone. Numerous ex vivo studies on either cortical or cancellous bone have demonstrated that ionizing radiation degrades mechanical properties and collagen molecular structure independent of cellular activity. The demonstrated reduction in post-yield properties — ultimate strain, ultimate strength, fracture toughness, work-to-failure — of irradiated bone [10–15] has been attributed to changes in collagen molecular structure [16–18]. Though the exact mechanism dominating irradiation-induced collagen degradation is not fully known, two mechanisms have been suggested as causes for diminished mechanics [10,12–14,19–23]. First, the collagen backbone can be fragmented when the molecular bonds are cleaved directly by x- and gamma-rays, breaking the intact protein chain into smaller polypeptides. Second, collagen molecules can be non-enzymatically crosslinked when radiolysis of water molecules creates free radicals, which cause inter- and intra- molecular bonds within collagen chains. However, it remains unclear which mechanism is more causative and at what dose these mechanisms manifest. Because changes in collagen structure are associated with a number of clinical conditions, an improved biomechanical understanding of each mechanism (i.e. non-enzymatic crosslinks and fragmentation) may provide insight into applications of irradiation [22], and also aging [24] and diabetes [25–28]. Addressing these issues, we conducted an ex vivo ionizing radiation experiment on mouse vertebrae spanning a range of clinically-related radiation doses (i.e. radiation therapy to allograft sterilization) and conducted a suite of mechanical and biochemical assays to assess radiation-induced changes. Specifically, our objectives were to: 1) quantify the effects of radiation dose on the monotonic strength and fatigue life of murine vertebrae; and 2) determine whether the degradation in mechanical properties is dominated by the amount of non-enzymatic crosslinks or fragmented collagen.",
    "results": "",
    "conclusion": "These results demonstrate that the monotonic strength of murine vertebral bodies was only diminished when exposed to ionizing radiation at or above 17,000 Gy. While the relative amount of non-enzymatic collagen crosslinks was greater for all radiation groups compared to the control, the increase in crosslinks measured at lower doses (50 and 1,000 Gy) did not coincide with the observed reduction in mechanical strength (Figure 4). In contrast to crosslinks, collagen fragmentation was only observed at doses where reduced mechanical properties were also observed (17,000 and 35,000 Gy; Figure 4). Thus, our results suggest that the fragmentation of collagen — and not the accumulation of non-enzymatic collagen crosslinks — was the primary molecular mechanism that caused the observed reductions in mechanical properties in whole bones exposed to ionizing radiation. Our results are consistent with previous radiation studies and provide novel insight into the effect of ex vivo ionizing radiation on bone mechanics. In accordance with previous investigations of cortical bone, we observed a reduction in both monotonic and fatigue properties at a dose equivalent to nominal allograft sterilization of ~30,000 ± 5,000 Gy [10,15,20,37–39], and a reduction of monotonic strength at 17,000 Gy [11]. While our study is consistent with earlier observations, our findings expand upon previous knowledge in three important areas. First, previous inquiries have been conducted on either cortical [10,11,15,20,37–39] or trabecular [40] bone tissue specimens, not whole-bones. Second, mechanical characterization has been primarily conducted in either monotonic or fatigue loading conditions, not both. Finally, only a subset of these studies has conducted concurrent collagen biochemical analysis, quantifying either crosslinks [13] or fragmentation [10,37,39]. For the first time, we have demonstrated the effect of irradiation on whole-bones (with both cortical and trabecular tissue) across a spectrum of clinically-relevant doses (i.e. radiation therapy at 50 Gy to allograft sterilization at 35,000 Gy) with both monotonic and fatigue mechanical tests, as well as parallel collagen biochemical assays. We expand on the work of Currey et al. [11] and demonstrate that in addition to a reduction in monotonic strength following irradiation at 17,000 Gy, fatigue properties are also significantly reduced. Importantly, we have demonstrated the doses at which the differences in collagen structure and mechanics arise. Our results provide new insight into the type of molecular change driving the degradation of whole-bone strength and fatigue life following irradiation. While the exact collagen modifications dominating reduced strength following irradiation are not fully understood, we examined the two proposed mechanisms: photon-induced fragmentation of the collagen backbone [10,20] or radiolysis-induced non-enzymatic collagen crosslinks [12,13,21–23]. Our results suggest that increased collagen fragmentation, and not non-enzymatic crosslinking, is the dominant factor. While no previous studies have quantified the fragmentation of collagen in irradiated whole-bones, our results are in agreement with previous work on cortical bone, which demonstrated that diminished fracture toughness at doses of ~35,000 Gy was a result of collagen fragmentation [10,37]. Expanding on this knowledge, we demonstrate that collagen fragmentation leads to degraded murine whole-bone mechanics at 17,000 Gy, a dose signifiantly lower than the standard for allograft sterilization (25,000 – 35,000 Gy). Our findings emphasize the need for further research into novel radioprotectants that target fragmentation in order to maintain bone strength when sterilizing allografts with radiation [10]. Importantly, our findings suggest that non-enzymatic collagen crosslinks may play a smaller role in degrading mechanical strength of bone than previously considered. Previously, numerous studies attributed the increase in non-enzymatic crosslink concentration as the primary mechanism for degraded bone strength, specifically in applications of natural aging [24,36,41], drug treatments [42], irradiation sterilization [13], and diseases such as osteoporosis [43] and diabetes [26,44–47]. While the concentration of non-enzymatic crosslinks does accumulate in bone collagen in these applications, any causation of those crosslinks with respect to degraded mechanical properties has not been established. Here, we observed that despite a substantial (95%) increase in crosslink concentration, we could not detect any effect on vertebral strength. Indeed, studies have demonstrated that an increase in non-enzymatic crosslinks induced via ribose incubation can be used to counter the loss of strength due to the fragmentation of the collagen network, not degrade it further [39,48,49]. Taken together, our results strengthen the argument that the contribution of non-enzymatic crosslinks to diminished bone strength with disease and aging plays a smaller role in comparison to other factors, such as collagen network connectivity [50]. There are some limitations in this study. First, because we tested mouse bone, the direct application of our findings to human bone is unclear. However, as discussed above, similar trends in irradiation-induced degraded bone strength [10,11,15,20,37–39,51–55] and molecular-level changes [10,55] have been seen in other studies across a number of anatomic sites and species, including human bone. That consistency suggests our results are not limited to murine bone. Second, as an ex vivo study, we excluded the impact of any biologically induced responses to radiation in order to explore the extent to which radiation directly alters the mechanical behavior of the bone matrix. For applications of allograft sterilization, which are only conducted ex vivo, excluding cellular effects is appropriate. However, for in vivo applications of radiation therapy, there can be cellular-driven changes, such as reduced bone volume fraction or altered trabecular microarchitecture [50], which can alter bone mechanics beyond what is reported here. Thus, our method of irradiation is directly comparable to ex vivo allograft sterilization; for doses equivalent to in vivo radiotherapy treatment (50 Gy), our method is only applicable when considering the direct effects of radiation on the bone matrix. Additionally, we performed all mechanical tests, monotonic and cyclic, in compression. While compressive loading is most relevant for in vivo behavior, the response may be different for isolated specimens tested in pure tension. Finally, because our study did not investigate doses between 1,000 and 17,000 Gy, it is unclear at what dose within this range reduced mechanical properties can first be observed. To address this gap, we conducted a post-hoc study for doses of 5,000 and 10,000 Gy (see Appendix) with the same mechanical and biochemical assays described above. We found some mechanical differences occurred with radiation exposure of 5,000 Gy (and above), but only for cyclic loading: compared to the control, fatigue life was lower by 18% (p < 0.01) but monotonic strength was not different (p = 0.12). These ad hoc results confirm previous observations that cyclic loading may be a more sensitive test than monotonic loading for detecting mechanical effects of radiation [13,20]. Clinically, radiation-induced fractures are often observed months to years after irradiation and classified as spontaneous or insufficiency fractures (i.e. fractures which are not the result of a fall or trauma, and more likely due to repetitive loading at low forces over time) [56–58]. As such, it is clinically important to consider mechanisms that can affect cyclic loading properties differently than static loading properties. Furthermore, our findings have expanded our knowledge to show fatigue properties are also significantly reduced with doses as low as 5,000 Gy. Clinically, our results have implications for safe sterilization of allografts and potential radioprotectants. A dose of 11,000 Gy has been proposed as a safe sterilization dose for allografts [59], as this dose achieves the same sterility level as the current standard dose of 30,000 ± 5,000 Gy [4,5]. However, our supplemental findings suggest collagen fragmentation and associated loss of cyclic mechanical properties can begin with a dose as low as 5,000 Gy (see Appendix). To mitigate the loss of mechanical integrity, further studies are needed to investigate how to safeguard the bone with a radioprotectant. Several radioprotectants have been considered for their ability to preserve tissue properties following irradiation [4,49,60]. Based on our results, we would recommend studies focused on radioprotectants which can prevent or offset the fragmentation of collagen, as these types of radioprotectants may preserve bone mechanics to a greater degree than those which protect against non-enzymatic collagen crosslinks. Our results also have implications for understanding the etiology of the increased fracture risk associated with in vivo radiation therapy treatment for cancer [2,8,61–66]. We did not observe any change in mechanical behavior for ex vivo dose levels relevant to radiation therapy (i.e. 50 Gy), despite an increase in collagen crosslinks. Thus, direct effects of radiation on the collagen matrix from radiation therapy are not solely responsible for the increased fracture risk observed clinically. From this, we can infer that the cellular processes of bone remodeling due to in vivo irradiation are likely the root cause. Indeed, previous in vivo irradiation studies of bone in a murine model have shown reduced trabecular bone mass, number and connectivity associated with hyperactive osteoclast activity [67–69]. Taken together with our ex vivo observations, cell-mediated changes in bone quantity, trabecular microarchitecture, or tissue material quality are more plausible explanations for the increased fracture risk from radiation therapy than direct changes to the bone material. In summary, we quantified the level of collagen fragmentation and non-enzymatic collagen crosslinks in the organic matrix of murine whole-bones at clinically-relevant ex vivo radiation doses. Our results suggest that the fragmentation of collagen — and not the accumulation of non-enzymatic collagen crosslinks — was the primary molecular mechanism that caused the observed monotonic mechanical degradation at 17,000 Gy and above, and cyclic mechanical degradation at 5,000 Gy and above.",

Mutations in and loss of DGC proteins cause a spectrum of muscular dystrophies. When only the sarcoglycan subcomplex is absent, muscles display severe myofiber degeneration, but little susceptibility to contractile damage, suggesting that disease occurs not by structural deficits but through aberrant signaling, namely, loss of normal mechanotransduction signaling through the sarcoglycan complex. We extended our previous studies on mechanosensitive, γ-sarcoglycan-dependent ERK1/2 phosphorylation, to determine whether additional pathways are altered with the loss of γ-sarcoglycan.",

In contrast, in isolated muscles, p70S6K was mechanically responsive. Basal p70S6K activation was elevated in muscles of γ-SG-/- mice, in a calcium-independent manner. p70S6K activation increased with stretch in both C57 and γ-SG-/- isolated muscles, and was sustained in γ-SG-/- muscles, unlike the transient response in C57 muscles. Rapamycin treatment blocked all of p70S6K activation in stretched C57 muscles, and reduced downstream S6RP phosphorylation.

These proteins are involved in diverse cellular processes, including vacuole biogenesis and stress tolerance. A previously uncharacterized protein, named TNO1 (for TGN-localized SYP41-interacting protein), was identified by coimmunoprecipitation as a SYP41-interacting protein. TNO1 was found to localize to the TGN by immunofluorescence microscopy. A tno1 mutant showed increased sensitivity to high concentrations of NaCl, KCl, and LiCl and also to mannitol-induced osmotic stress. Localization of SYP61, which is involved in the salt stress response, was disrupted in the tno1 mutant. Vacuolar proteins were partially secreted to the apoplast in the tno1 mutant, suggesting that TNO1 is required for efficient protein trafficking to the vacuole. The tno1 mutant had delayed formation of the brefeldin A (BFA) compartment in cotyledons upon application of BFA, suggesting less efficient membrane fusion processes in the mutant. Unlike most TGN proteins, TNO1 does not relocate to the BFA compartment upon BFA treatment. These data demonstrate that TNO1 is involved in vacuolar trafficking and salt tolerance, potentially via roles in vesicle fusion and in maintaining TGN structure or identity.",

    "abstract": "SNAREs play an important role in the process of membrane trafficking. In the present research, we investigated subcellular localization of an uncharacterized Arabidopsis thaliana protein reported to interact with a trans-Golgi network-localized Qa-SNARE, SYNTAXIN OF PLANTS 43. Based on the similarity of its amino acid sequence to metazoan fucosyltransferases, we have named this novel protein AtGTLP (Arabidopsis thaliana GlycosylTransferase-Like Protein) and predicted that it should be a member of yet uncharacterized family of Arabidopsis fucosyltransferases, as it shows no significant sequence similarity to fucosyltransferases previously identified in Arabidopsis. AtGTLP is a membrane-anchored protein, which exhibits a type II-like topology, with a single transmembrane helix and a globular domain in the C-terminal part of its amino acid sequence. Colocalization data we collected suggest that AtGTLP should localize mainly to Golgi apparatus, especially to certain zones of trans-Golgi. As single atgtlp−/− mutants showed no obvious difference in phenotype (primary root length and fresh mass), AtGTLP and proteins related to AtGTLP with high similarity in amino acid sequences may have redundant functions.",
    "introduction": "An efficient and well-organized intracellular transport system is a basic requirement for life to exist, as many components necessary for metabolic processes, that take place inside or outside of a eukaryotic cell, are produced and subsequently modified in different cell compartments. The transport system responsible for delivering cargo collected from one compartment (that is: a membrane-enclosed organelle, such as endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi, or vacuole) to its next destination has been given the name of “membrane traffic”. In the membrane traffic, macromolecules are packed as cargo into vesicles, which then carry the cargo to another organelle, plasma membrane or extracellular space. SNARE (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment receptor) proteins, a family of membrane-anchored proteins comprising of more than 60 members in Arabidopsis (Sanderfoot 2007), play an important role in this transport system. Assisted by other molecules, such as Rab GTPases and tethering factors, SNAREs mediate fusion between the membrane of vesicle carrying the cargo and the membrane of the organelle the cargo is addressed to (Stenmark 2009). To facilitate the fusion, SNAREs form a complex comprising of four SNAREs—three Q-SNAREs (Qa-, Qb-, Qc-SNARE), which reside on the target membrane and are characterized by the presence of glutamine as the central amino acid in SNARE motif, in addition to one R-SNARE residing on the transport vesicle, with arginine as the central amino acid (Fasshauer et al. 1998). When a R-SNARE comes into contact with the three Q-SNAREs, first a link is formed between the vesicle and the target membrane, and subsequently, due to the change in conformation of the SNARE complex from “loose” to “tight” state, the vesicle is pulled toward the target membrane, allowing the two membranes to fuse together and the cargo to enter the lumen of the organelle (Jahn and Scheller 2006). To ensure the specificity of fusion, a large number of SNAREs localizes selectively to a specific cell compartment. This characteristic made it possible for those SNAREs to be successfully used as organelle markers in subcellular localization studies (Uemura et al. 2004). Through their crucial role in membrane trafficking, members of SNARE family in plants were reported to be implicit in a variety of biological processes, ranging from growth to biotic/abiotic stress resistance. One group of SNAREs, that has been linked to secretion-dependent resistance against pathogens, is SYP4 (SYNTAXIN of PLANTs 4) group. SYP4 group comprises of three members (SYP41, SYP42 and SYP43) with partially overlapping functions, all localizing to the TGN (trans-Golgi network). syp42−/−syp43−/− double mutant exhibits phenotype of shorter roots, semi-dwarfism, and early senescence, in addition to increase in susceptibility to host-adapted virulent powdery fungus Golovinomyces orontii infection, when compared to wild type (Uemura et al. 2012). A research focused on interactome of Qa-SNARE proteins in Arabidopsis reported a number of new interactions between specific SNARE proteins and numerous proteins of diverse functions, including novel proteins with unknown functions (Fujiwara et al. 2014). One such interaction was found between SYP43 and an uncharacterized protein, which we decided to name AtGTLP (Arabidopsis thaliana GlycosylTransferase-Like Protein) due to the similarity to glycosyltransferases in its amino acid sequence. Glycosyltransferases (GTs) are a large family of enzymes, characterized by their ability to transfer sugar moieties to a specific acceptor substrate creating a glycosidic bond. GTs are known to produce a variety of glycoproteins and small sugar-containing molecules with diverse biological roles, but in plants, these enzymes are especially important for processing products of photosynthesis and for biosynthesis of cell-wall (Keegstra and Raikhel 2001). At present, 567 Arabidopsis proteins recorded in the Carbohydrate Active Enzyme Database (CAZy) (Cantarel et al. 2009; http://www.cazy.org/e1.html, accessed Nov 1, 2023) with ‘GlycosylTransferase’ annotation have been further classified into 45 of 117 GT families known today (including GT0 or GTnc, ‘non-classified’). Independently from the sequence-based classification implemented in CAZy database, GTs can also be categorized according to the type of sugar they use as a substrate. One such example is the superfamily of fucosyltransferases (FUTs), which utilize guanidine 5′-diphosphate-β-L-fucose (GDP-Fuc) as a substrate (Martinez-Duncker et al. 2003). In plants, macromolecules known to incorporate fucose in their structures are N-glycans, O-fucosylated proteins, as well as components of cell walls, such as xyloglucans, arabinogalactan proteins and pectic polysaccharides—rhamnogalacturonan I (RG-I) and rhamnogalacturonan II (RG-II) (Soto et al. 2019). Based on characteristics of FUTs that have been identified thus far (a majority of which are putative fucosyltransferases), it has been established that fucose is attached to each of these types of macromolecules by a specific FUT(s). As our knowledge about plant FUTs is still lacking, the full scope of their biological functions is, at present, not fully understood. In the present study, we observed subcellular localization of AtGTLP by cross-pollinating a transgenic Arabidopsis line expressing AtGTLP-mGFP construct with organelle marker lines, as the first step to investigate the functions of AtGTLP.",

Directional growth of roots occurs by a combination of sensing external cues, hormonal signaling and cytoskeletal changes in the root cells. Roots growing on slanted, impenetrable growth medium display a characteristic waving and skewing, and mutants with deviations in these phenotypes assist in identifying genes required for root movement. Our study identifies a role for a trans-Golgi network-localized protein in root skewing.",

Skewing of tno1 roots increases upon microtubule stabilization, but is insensitive to microtubule destabilization. Microtubule destabilization leads to severe defects in cell morphology in tno1 seedlings. Microtubule array orientation is unaffected in the mutant roots, suggesting that the increase in cell file rotation is independent of the orientation of microtubule arrays.",

The TGN-localized SNARE machinery might therefore be important for appropriate epidermal cell file rotation and cell expansion during root growth.",

    "abstract": "The trans-Golgi network (TGN) is a dynamic organelle that functions as a relay station for receiving endocytosed cargo, directing secretory cargo, and trafficking to the vacuole. TGN-localized SYP41-interacting protein (TNO1) is a large, TGN-localized, coiled-coil protein that associates with the membrane fusion protein SYP41, a target SNARE, and is required for efficient protein trafficking to the vacuole. Here, we show that a tno1 mutant has auxin transport-related defects. Mutant roots have delayed lateral root emergence, decreased gravitropic bending of plant organs and increased sensitivity to the auxin analog 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid and the natural auxin 3-indoleacetic acid. Auxin asymmetry at the tips of elongating stage II lateral roots was reduced in the tno1 mutant, suggesting a role for TNO1 in cellular auxin transport during lateral root emergence. During gravistimulation, tno1 roots exhibited delayed auxin transport from the columella to the basal epidermal cells. Endocytosis to the TGN was unaffected in the mutant, indicating that bulk endocytic defects are not responsible for the observed phenotypes. Together these studies demonstrate a role for TNO1 in mediating auxin responses during root development and gravistimulation, potentially through trafficking of auxin transport proteins.",
    "introduction": "The trans-Golgi network (TGN) is a highly dynamic tubulo-vesicular organelle that matures from the two or three trans-most cisternae of the Golgi (Staehelin and Kang, 2008) and is crucial for endocytic, secretory and vacuolar trafficking routes in plant cells. TGN cisternae move rapidly inside the cell, dissociating from their associated Golgi and re-associating with a new Golgi stack (Staehelin and Kang, 2008; Kang, 2011; Uemura et al., 2014), and also contain distinct subdomains for various trafficking routes (Bassham et al., 2000; Chow et al., 2008; Gendre et al., 2011). The TGN functions as an early/recycling endosome (Dettmer et al., 2006; Viotti et al., 2010) that receives endocytosed cargo, including auxin transporters, plasma membrane receptors, and nutrient transporters (Russinova et al., 2004; Robatzek et al., 2006; Dhonukshe et al., 2007; Takano et al., 2010; Barberon et al., 2011), and recycles it back to the plasma membrane or to the vacuole for degradation. The TGN plays a crucial role in trafficking of biosynthetic traffic to the vacuole (Reyes et al., 2011). It also directs secretory cargo, including plasma membrane proteins and cell wall polysaccharides, to the cell surface, potentially via mobile secretory vesicle clusters that fuse with the plasma membrane (Toyooka et al., 2009; Gendre et al., 2014). The position of the TGN at the junction of the endocytic, vacuolar, and secretory pathways renders it important in regulating transport of key molecules and mediating cellular responses to the environment (Park and Jurgens, 2011; Reyes et al., 2011; Contento and Bassham, 2012). High transport fidelity is needed to prevent mis-sorting of cargo during vesicle trafficking. This requires membrane fusion proteins termed soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptors (SNAREs; Risselada and Grubmuller, 2012). SNAREs can be broadly classified as target SNARES (t-SNAREs) or vesicle SNAREs (v-SNAREs) depending on their location, or as Q or R-SNAREs based on the core amino acid in the heptad repeat of the SNARE motif (Fasshauer et al., 1998). The interaction between a v-SNARE on a vesicle and t-SNAREs on its target membrane leads to membrane fusion via formation of a tetrameric trans-SNARE complex (McNew et al., 2000; Lipka et al., 2007; Kim and Brandizzi, 2012; Risselada and Grubmuller, 2012). Usually, three Q SNAREs (Qa, Qb, and Qc) form a t-SNARE complex and an R-SNARE acts as the v-SNARE. This interaction of SNAREs helps to overcome the thermodynamically unfavorable event of fusion of two hydrophobic lipid bilayers (Risselada and Grubmuller, 2012; Shi et al., 2012), enabling deposition of cargo into the target organelle. Proteins known as tethering factors aid in bringing membranes together and promoting SNARE interaction or actively stimulating trans-SNARE complex formation (Cai et al., 2007). Tethering factors thus increase vesicular trafficking efficiency (Sztul and Lupashin, 2009; Chia and Gleeson, 2011; Hong and Lev, 2014) and are either homodimeric long coiled-coil proteins or multisubunit tethering complexes (Markgraf et al., 2007; Hong and Lev, 2014). It was recently proposed that coiled-coil tethers simultaneously use their multiple coiled-coil domains to engage distinct SNAREs and promote SNARE complex assembly (Grabski et al., 2012). Spatiotemporal regulation of trafficking steps in the cell also requires a family of small GTPases called Rabs which then recruit downstream effectors (Stenmark, 2009). Tethers can act as Rab effectors by binding SNAREs or can function as GTP exchange factors (GEFs) for Rabs (Markgraf et al., 2007; Sztul and Lupashin, 2009; Hong and Lev, 2014). Many SNAREs and tethering factors exist in Arabidopsis thaliana, with different localizations reflecting their specialized roles (Fujimoto and Ueda, 2012). The TGN-localized SYP4 (41/42/43) SNARE family (Bassham et al., 2000; Uemura et al., 2012) is responsible for maintaining Golgi/TGN morphology and regulating secretory and vacuolar trafficking (Uemura et al., 2012). Another TGN SNARE, SYP61, interacts with SYP41 and helps to direct traffic to the plasma membrane (Drakakaki et al., 2012), with a role in mediating stress responses (Zhu et al., 2002). Recently, TGN-localized SYP41-interacting protein (TNO1), a large coiled-coil protein localized to the TGN, was identified as a SYP41 interactor (Kim and Bassham, 2011) and was hypothesized to be a tethering factor. Mutant plants lacking TNO1 partially mis-sort vacuolar cargo and mis-localize SYP61, suggesting decreased trafficking fidelity, while also showing hypersensitivity to salt and osmotic stress and displaying altered TGN dynamics (Kim and Bassham, 2011). SYP42 and SYP43 play a role in root gravitropism, most likely via regulation of the localization of the auxin eﬄux transporters PIN-FORMED 1 (PIN1) and PIN2 (Uemura et al., 2012). Additionally, other proteins involved in auxin transport, such as the AUXIN1/LIKE-AUX1 (AUX1/LAX) family of auxin influx transporters and P-glycoprotein (PGP) proteins of the ATP-binding cassette transporter family, are localized via the SNAREs and TGN activity (Kleine-Vehn and Friml, 2008; Rakusová et al., 2015). Many of the auxin transporters undergo constitutive endocytosis, cycling between the recycling endosome/TGN and the plasma membrane, or are targeted for vacuolar degradation to maintain steady-state levels (Kleine-Vehn and Friml, 2008; Grunewald and Friml, 2010). Defects in TGN dynamics can, therefore, hamper recycling of these transporters and thus affect directional transport of auxin, which is critical for plant development (Grunewald and Friml, 2010). Given the potential links between TGN-mediated protein trafficking and auxin transporters, we investigated auxin responses in the tno1 mutant during root development. Loss of TNO1 delayed lateral root (LR) emergence and decreased root and hypocotyl gravitropic bending. Additionally, tno1 roots failed to display characteristic asymmetry visualized with the auxin response marker DR5rev:GFP at the LR tips as well as after gravistimulation. Thus, TNO1 functions in auxin-mediated root development and response to gravity.",

    "conclusion": "Auxin flow in plants is an important determinant of root architecture and tropic bending such as gravitropism. The polar transport of auxin depends on the specific localization of auxin transporters, which in turn is dependent on the cellular trafficking machinery. The TGN is an important organelle controlling vesicle trafficking, with the presence of multiple proteins that aid the trafficking of cargoes such as auxin transporters. In this study we have demonstrated a role for a putative tethering factor localized at the TGN in efficient gravitropic bending and LR emergence, possibly by affecting auxin transport.",

    "introduction": "The movement of plant roots within the soil is key to their ability to interact with the environment and maximize anchorage and nutrient acquisition. Directional growth of roots occurs by a combination of sensing external cues, hormonal signaling and cytoskeletal changes in the root cells. Roots growing on slanted, impenetrable growth medium display a characteristic waving and skewing, and mutants with deviations in these phenotypes assist in identifying genes required for root movement. Our study identifies a role for a trans-Golgi network-localized protein in root skewing.",
    "results": "We found that Arabidopsis thaliana TNO1 (TGN-localized SYP41-interacting protein), a putative tethering factor localized at the trans-Golgi network, affects root skewing. tno1 knockout mutants display enhanced root skewing and epidermal cell file rotation. Skewing of tno1 roots increases upon microtubule stabilization, but is insensitive to microtubule destabilization. Microtubule destabilization leads to severe defects in cell morphology in tno1 seedlings. Microtubule array orientation is unaffected in the mutant roots, suggesting that the increase in cell file rotation is independent of the orientation of microtubule arrays.",
    "conclusion": "We conclude that TNO1 modulates root skewing in a mechanism that is dependent on microtubules but is not linked to disruption of the orientation of microtubule arrays. In addition, TNO1 is required for maintenance of cell morphology in mature regions of roots and the base of hypocotyls. The TGN-localized SNARE machinery might therefore be important for appropriate epidermal cell file rotation and cell expansion during root growth.",

    "link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2915878/",
    "abstract": "Maintaining the proximity of centrosomes to nuclei is important in several cellular contexts, and LINC complexes formed by SUN and KASH proteins are crucial in this process. Here, we characterize the presumed Drosophila ortholog of the mammalian SUN protein, sperm-associated antigen 4 (Spag4, previously named Giacomo), and demonstrate that Spag4 is required for centriole and nuclear attachment during spermatogenesis. Production of spag4 mRNA is limited to the testis, and Spag4 protein shows a dynamic pattern of association with the germline nuclei, including a concentration of protein at the site of attachment of the single spermatid centriole. In the absence of Spag4, nuclei and centrioles or basal bodies (BBs) dissociate from each other after meiosis. This role of Spag4 in centriolar attachment does not involve either of the two KASH proteins of the Drosophila genome (Klarsicht and MSP-300), but does require the coiled-coil protein Yuri Gagarin. Yuri shows an identical pattern of localization at the nuclear surface to Spag4 during spermatogenesis, and epistasis studies show that the activities of Yuri and dynein-dynactin are downstream of spag4 in this centriole attachment pathway. The later defects in spermatogenesis seen for yuri and spag4 mutants are similar, suggesting they could be secondary to initial disruption of events at the nuclear surface.",
    "introduction": "Within eukaryotic cells, a centrosome or spindle-pole body (SPB) functions as a microtubule-organizing center (MTOC) and is typically found closely apposed to the nuclear membrane. Disruption of the MTOC-nucleus association frequently leads to cellular abnormalities, including defective nuclear positioning (Malone et al., 1999; Starr et al., 2001), abnormal morphology of cells and organelles (Fischer-Vize and Mosley, 1994; Mosley-Bishop et al., 1999; Patterson et al., 2004), altered cell migration (Gomes et al., 2005; Lüke et al., 2008) and defective chromosome segregation during mitosis (Malone et al., 2003; Xiong et al., 2008). These findings indicate that the nuclear-MTOC association is essential in many cellular processes. Nuclear-MTOC association is often maintained by a LINC complex comprising SUN (Sad1/UNC) and KASH (Klar-ANC-Syne homology) proteins (Gruenbaum et al., 2005; Starr and Fischer, 2005; Crisp et al., 2006; Stewart-Hutchinson et al., 2008). SUN and KASH proteins are integral membrane proteins of the inner and outer nuclear membranes (INM and ONM), respectively. These proteins interact with each other in the intermembrane space via their C-terminal SUN and KASH domains (McGee et al., 2006; Kracklauer et al., 2007). The N-terminal domains of SUN proteins face the nucleoplasmic side of the INM, interacting with the nuclear lamina or with chromatin (Bray et al., 2002; Hodzic et al., 2004; King et al., 2008; Xiong et al., 2008). N-terminal domains of KASH proteins typically face the cytoplasm, and interact with components of the actin or microtubule filament systems (Starr and Han, 2002; Zhang et al., 2002; Fischer et al., 2004; Wilhelmsen et al., 2005; Ketema et al., 2007). A detailed model for the mechanism by which the Caenorhabditis elegans KASH protein ZYG-12 links the zygotic centrosome to the nuclear envelope (NE) has been proposed (Malone et al., 2003), which involves direct interaction of certain ZYG-12 isoforms with the microtubule motor dynein. The Drosophila genome encodes two KASH protein genes, klarsicht (Mosley-Bishop et al., 1999) and msp-300 (Zhang et al., 2002) and two SUN protein genes, klaroid (Kracklauer et al., 2007) and gene CG6589. CG6589, previously termed giacomo, has proved to have sequence homology to the testis-specific mammalian SUN protein Spag4 (Shao et al., 1999; Kennedy et al., 2004) (supplementary material Fig. S1) and thus we have re-named the gene spag4. We show here that Spag4 has a crucial role in spermatogenesis comparable to that of other SUN proteins: it is necessary for anchoring the centriole or basal body (BB) to the spermatid nucleus. But surprisingly, this role does not require formation of a typical LINC complex with a KASH protein. Instead, we have shown that the coiled-coil cytoplasmic protein Yuri Gagarin (Armstrong et al., 2006; Texada et al., 2008) is an essential component of the Spag4-BB anchoring mechanism, and that regulation of dynein-dynactin localization by Spag4 has a role in the process.",

    "title": "Toll mediated infection response is altered by gravity and spaceflight in Drosophila",
    "link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3901686/",
    "abstract": "Space travel presents unlimited opportunities for exploration and discovery, but requires better understanding of the biological consequences of long-term exposure to spaceflight. Immune function in particular is relevant for space travel. Human immune responses are weakened in space, with increased vulnerability to opportunistic infections and immune-related conditions. In addition, microorganisms can become more virulent in space, causing further challenges to health. To understand these issues better and to contribute to design of effective countermeasures, we used the Drosophila model of innate immunity to study immune responses in both hypergravity and spaceflight. Focusing on infections mediated through the conserved Toll and Imd signaling pathways, we found that hypergravity improves resistance to Toll-mediated fungal infections except in a known gravitaxis mutant of the yuri gagarin gene. These results led to the first spaceflight project on Drosophila immunity, in which flies that developed to adulthood in microgravity were assessed for immune responses by transcription profiling on return to Earth. Spaceflight alone altered transcription, producing activation of the heat shock stress system. Space flies subsequently infected by fungus failed to activate the Toll pathway. In contrast, bacterial infection produced normal activation of the Imd pathway. We speculate on possible linkage between functional Toll signaling and the heat shock chaperone system. Our major findings are that hypergravity and spaceflight have opposing effects, and that spaceflight produces stress-related transcriptional responses and results in a specific inability to mount a Toll-mediated infection response.",
    "introduction": "Human space exploration, with its promise of unprecedented discoveries, excites the imagination. However, turning the exploration of space into a practical reality presents daunting challenges including conquering the compromised biological functions produced by spaceflight. In order to achieve space exploration, a better understanding of human biology, both on earth and in space, is required. Among the many aspects of biology affected by spaceflight, we have focused on the immune response. Immune dysfunction is a major health-related problem on earth and a major obstacle to long-term space missions [1]. As early as the Apollo and Skylab missions, immune dysfunction was recognized in astronauts, and later studies documented specific host cellular and humoral immune alterations induced by spaceflight [1]. Increased microbial growth and virulence in space have also been documented [2]. Spaceflight is associated with many stresses, with altered gravitational force (g) representing the most studied factor. Microgravity (µg) is constant in space, and hypergravity (hyper g) is experienced during launch and landing. Immune dysfunction in both µg and hyper g is well documented, but determination of the underlying cellular mechanisms and thus routes to appropriate countermeasures, remains unresolved [2], [3], [4], [5], [6]. Without normal immune function, many threats to long-term survival in space exist: fatal infections, failed immunosurveillance of cancer cells, aberrant inflammatory responses and reactivation of latent viruses are all potential hazards. In our work, we have brought advances in understanding the host defense of Drosophila to bear on deciphering the immune alterations associated with altered gravity and spaceflight. Drosophila is a well-established model for human innate immune function, sharing elements in cellular and humoral immunity, clotting and wound healing, and signaling pathways [7]. Drosophila responds to microbial infection with 1) a systemic response, characterized by fat body production of antimicrobial proteins (AMPs), 2) tissue specific responses, such as production of AMPs in the gut and trachea, 3) phagocytosis by hemocytes, and 4) clotting and wound healing [7], [8], [9], [10]. Two signaling pathways are the main mediators of the response to bacterial and fungal infections in Drosophila [7], [11], [12]. The Toll pathway primarily responds to fungal and Gram-positive (Lys-type peptidoglycan (PGN)) infections, and the Imd pathway responds to Gram-negative (DAP-type PGN) infections [7]. Toll-like receptors (Tlrs) have been identified in mammals and are the direct mediators of responses to activators such as bacterial lipopolysacccharide and viral DNA [13]. Imd shares homology with the death domain of the mammalian Receptor Interacting Protein of the Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor pathway [7]. Downstream, through the conserved NF-kB/Rel protein transcription factors relish (Imd signaling cascade), and DIF and dorsal (Toll signaling cascade), the AMPs and ∼400 other genes are involved in response to infection [7], [14], [15]. Recognition of the complexity of the Toll and Imd pathways continues to grow, for example with identification of new regulators, interactions with the nervous system, and modification with aging [16], [17], [18], [19]. In contrast to mammals, in Drosophila only the original Toll was associated with infection response, through indirect sensing mediated by binding to Spätzle (Spz). More recently however, other Toll family members have been identified as mediating infection. Toll-8 regulates infection response in the airway epithelium [20], and Toll-7 is involved in viral recognition and response [21]. The mechanisms of interactions within and between the Toll and Imd pathways and other systems are not fully understood, and unraveling the interrelationships will require many approaches. Here, we present genetic and transcriptional profiling experiments to address the response to infection in conditions related to space travel: Does hypergravity affect the response to fungal infection? Does development during spaceflight alter the response to bacterial and fungal infections?",

    "link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6387434/",
    "abstract": "Space radiation has recently been considered a risk factor for astronauts’ cardiac health. As an example, for the case of how to query and identify datasets within NASA’s GeneLab database and demonstrate the database utility, we used an unbiased systems biology method for identifying key genes/drivers for the contribution of space radiation on the cardiovascular system. This knowledge can contribute to designing appropriate experiments targeting these specific pathways. Microarray data from cardiomyocytes of male C57BL/6 mice followed-up for 28 days after exposure to 900 mGy of 1 GeV proton or 150 mGy of 1 GeV/n 56Fe were compared to human endothelial cells (HUVECs) cultured for 7 days on the International Space Station (ISS). We observed common molecular pathways between simulated space radiation and HUVECs flown on the ISS. The analysis suggests FYN is the central driver/hub for the cardiovascular response to space radiation: the known oxidative stress induced immediately following radiation would only be transient and would upregulate FYN, which in turn would reduce reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, protecting the cardiovascular system. The transcriptomic signature of exposure to protons was also much closer to the spaceflight signature than 56Fe’s signature. To our knowledge, this is the first time GeneLab datasets were utilized to provide potential biological indications that the majority of ions on the ISS are protons, clearly illustrating the power of omics analysis. More generally, this work also demonstrates how to combine animal radiation studies done on the ground and spaceflight studies to evaluate human risk in space.",
    "introduction": "Long-duration space travel has been associated with a number of human health risk factors, such as space radiation, microgravity, isolation, and hypoxia [1,2,3,4]. It is now thought that the two main factors driving the majority of the health risks are space radiation and microgravity, with space radiation being the main component for health risk for space missions beyond low Earth orbit (LEO) [5,6,7,8,9,10]. The different organs and related health issues potentially induced by these two aspects of the space environment are continuously studied and updated. Space radiation observed on the International Space Station (ISS) is quite different from ionizing radiation found on Earth and is composed primarily of protons (both high and low energy) and HZE ions (high (H) atomic number (Z) and energy (E) ions). Protons are characterized by low linear energy transfer (LET) and HZE by high LET, as opposed to the low LET radiation (x-, β-, or γ-rays) to which humans are commonly exposed to on Earth [1,3,10,11,12,13]. HZE ions are positively charged and are the highly ionizing components of Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCRs) which originate outside of the solar system. The strong carcinogenic potential of HZE [14] has been a concern for many decades and has been considered the biggest risk factor for human health in missions beyond LEO [13,15]. In contrast, in LEO, where the ISS is located, the radiation dose from HZE is reduced due to the protection provided by the Earth’s magnetosphere, and is roughly equal to the dose from low-energy protons trapped in the inner radiation belt [13,16]. Most of the ISS orbit lies inside the radiation belts; the majority of the dose is from passages through the South Atlantic Anomaly, where the inner belt drops down to ISS altitudes. An additional risk for missions beyond LEO is from acute doses of high-energy protons from periodic solar particle events (SPEs) [14]. Data on the biological effects of space radiation has been obtained sporadically in true space conditions from samples flown in LEO (ISS, Space Shuttle, Mir Space Station, satellites carrying biology payloads). The majority of our data has been generated by simulating space radiation on Earth using specific HZE ions or protons at facilities such as the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory (NSRL) at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL). Simulated space radiation ground experiments have typically focused a lot more on HZE, reflecting the space radiation environment encountered in a long-duration beyond LEO mission [17]. To this day, a variety of results indicates that space radiation can increased cancer risk as well as contribute to diseases of the central nervous system (CNS), muscle degeneration, bone loss, and cardiovascular disease [10,15]. Radiation-induced late cardiovascular disease in astronauts is one increasingly prominent concern [7,18,19,20]. Although many experiments using low-LET radiation have been conducted to show damage to the microvasculature, HZE particle data are limited, and the implications for disease risk need more study. There have been even fewer ground-based studies of the synergistic effects of space radiation and microgravity, which more closely mimic the environment in space. Data from atomic bomb survivors, albeit with different types of radiation, on increased incidence of cardiovascular disease have shown long-lasting effects decades after radiation exposure impacting increased ischemic heart disease, hypertension, and stroke with doses as low as 2 Gy [21,22,23]. Animal and cell culture models have been used to simulate HZE particle and proton radiation and have shown that low doses of high-LET radiation can drastically affect the cardiovascular system [7,20,24,25,26,27,28]. Specifically, one experiment showed that mice exposed to 0.1 Gy of 150 MeV protons or 0.5 Gy of 600 MeV/n iron ions (56Fe) experienced large changes in cardiac DNA methylation with potential impacts including heart failure and cardiomyopathy [29]. 56Fe is the most predominant HZE particle in the GCRs, and is a commonly used surrogate for GCR HZE. Other experiments have shown that cells and animal models exposed to proton and HZE radiation increase DNA oxidation, myocardial fibrosis, endothelial dysfunction, and vascular damage [24,27,28,30]. Although these experiments and data have contributed to the overall knowledge of cardiovascular disease risk from space travel, there are many potential confounding factors besides space radiation (e.g., stress, hypoxia, microgravity). Therefore, our overall understanding of the contribution of space radiation in cardiovascular disease risk and their mechanisms remain an open question. To further pursue the cardiovascular impact due to space radiation we utilized publicly available transcriptomic data that is available on NASA’s GeneLab platform (genelab.nasa.gov) [17] related to cardiovascular disease and the space environment. NASA’s GeneLab platform is a resource available to the public that has provided the first comprehensive omics database related to space. Due to the limited omics data available related to space radiation and cardiovascular disease, we analyzed two datasets from ground experiments designed to characterize the long-term impact following space irradiation (protons and 56Fe) on cardiomyocytes for five different time-points up to 28 days after irradiation and one spaceflight experiment studying the impact of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) cultivated in the space environment on the ISS for seven days. Two components that make up the cardiac tissue are cardiomyocytes and endothelial cells and both cell types are heavily involved with cardiac remodeling and regeneration [31]. Although there are more components to the cardiac tissue, from the datasets available from the GeneLab related to the cardiovascular system, we will only focus on these components. Using these datasets, we hypothesized that there are common long-term molecules and pathways modulating the cardiovascular system due to radiation effects during spaceflight. Using a systems biology approach, we were able to suggest a novel mechanism through the FYN pathway [32,33,34,35] that the cardiovascular system uses to reduce reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels when exposed to space radiation. Briefly, FYN is a member of the Src family of tyrosine kinases that has been previously shown to be heavily involved with the cardiovascular system through cardiomyocyte remodeling [36,37] and also leads to activation due to ROS [32,33,38,39]. In addition to FYN’s involvement with the cardiovascular system, it has also been reported to be a tumor suppressor [40,41], a key player in controlling immune receptor signaling status and inflammation [42], and has been shown to affect myelination of the central nervous system through crosstalk with Erk1/2 signaling [43]. For our findings, although the ROS levels are reduced through Fyn signaling, we show the potential of other pathways that will still contribute to increased cardiovascular risk in the space environment such as increased inflammation. In addition, we are able to suggest that HUVEC cells grown on the ISS in LEO show a molecular response that is in agreement with responses observed on Earth with simulated protons but with less commonality with heavier HZE ions, as one would expect from the predominance of protons found in LEO space radiation. This finding is critical as it highlights the relevance of simulated space radiation experiments conducted on Earth, as they are shown here as able to recapitulate what is observed in space. This work illustrates the power of unbiased omics analysis and how the GeneLab database has become an essential tool to better characterize the response of a life to space environment. More generally, these novel findings have potential to contribute to current cardiovascular risk models for spaceflight.",

    "conclusion": "For long-term space travel, cardiovascular risk is a major concern to astronauts and is thought to arise from both microgravity effects and exposure to space radiation. Here we focused on how NASA’s GeneLab platform and datasets can be utilized to suggest the potential impact of space radiation on the cardiovascular system. Through an unbiased systems biology approach, we utilized three datasets (GLDS-52, -109, and -117) from NASA’s GeneLab platform that were related to space radiation and the cardiovascular system. Two of the datasets were from ground studies focused on cardiomyocytes that were isolated from mice after an acute whole-body dose of either 900 mGy of protons or 150 mGy of 56Fe [45]. The other study observed HUVECs for 7 days on the ISS [44]. As noted previously, the HUVECs received a total dose of 1.544 mGy, mostly from low LET protons. Through our unbiased analysis we were able to suggest: 1) that, consistent with the dose data, the majority of the radiation experienced on the ISS is potentially from protons (Figure 4D–F and Figure 2), a novel response mechanism of the cardiovascular system to prevent damage caused by space radiation through the activation of FYN. By identifying the key genes in all three datasets, we proposed that FYN is the most connected gene and is therefore the central hub for this common biological response. This leads us to hypothesize that there is a feedback loop triggered by the oxidative stress induced by space radiation that upregulates FYN which in turn reduces ROS levels, and thus ROS pathways. Interestingly, this feedback loop is accompanied with a downregulation of the DNA repair pathway in the animals but not in the HUVECs flown in space, suggesting a response that is more targeted to the cardiovascular system in a full organism (Figure 2). By reducing ROS formation, cardiomyocyte and endothelial cells are less likely to die, leading to an overall protection of the cardiovascular system (Figure 7). More specifically, FYN was found to be upregulated within each group of the key genes associated with each dataset providing an overall predicted inhibition of ROS and cell death, while causing an activation of inflammation due to space radiation. This effect was suggested to be long-term since the key factors were from common genes being regulated the same direction up to 28 days after irradiation for the ground studies.",

Finally, we propose two new principles that Big Data system developers, in particular, should consider for maximizing data accessibility.",
    "introduction": "Over the last decade the vast increase in outputs from “omics” (genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics) assays, together with decreasing assay and data storage costs, have resulted in an exponentially increasing volume of these “big” data. The high feature-number aspect of these big data has highlighted the importance of data sharing (or reuse) functions of these systems, as data sets often have relevance for investigating a very large number of hypotheses. Thus, developers of big data systems increasingly are focusing on the needs of users to discover, annotate, share, and analyze data. Omics data sharing is especially crucial to the biological research community, and the last decade or two has seen a huge rise in collaborative analysis systems1-3, databases4-14, and knowledge bases15-17 for omics and other systems biology data. The FAIR18 principles are a set of guiding principles that are being advocated as foundational in the broad areas of data findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability. However, the challenges involved in using current technologies and real-world infrastructures within organizational guidelines to develop data repositories and/or data analytical systems that are “FAIR” are substantial. The FAIR principles deal with aspects of data handling such as identification, representation, and attribution. Metrics to evaluate the “FAIRness” of a data system or its design are also currently being developed19. System developers should consider familiarizing themselves with these metrics, as many of the FAIR principles can have significant implications in terms of feasible design options and operations resource planning. We assessed the “FAIRness” of NASA’s GeneLab Data Systems (GLDS), along with four systems in the research omics data domain chosen for their similarity to the GLDS, using 14 FAIRness metrics. We relate these assessments in the context of discussion of the FAIRness concepts for the design of Big Data omics systems in particular, relating some of the challenges we faced developing the GLDS as a FAIR data system. In addition to designing a data system to be FAIR, developers of Big Data systems in particular should consider how system design can maximize data usability for its users. We propose two new design principles for FAIR systems that handle Big Data like omics data from our experiences developing the GLDS. By complying with these usability principles and the FAIR principles together, systems that manage Big Data can maximize both the usability and reusability of data.",
    "results": "",
    "conclusion": "The systems we assessed for FAIRness clearly have shortcomings, particularly in the area of supporting data interoperability. None of the systems currently use a metadata representation language with sufficient semantics. In addition, none fully leverage FAIR vocabularies for metadata. There are perhaps several causes at work for these observations. There are often myriad vocabularies (ontologies) for metadata (each of which is a de facto community standard) even within a given biological sub-domain, and often much overlap in semantic content between them, creating the need for systems to be able to “normalize” input metadata across them somehow. For example, the concept of zero or very low-gravity experimental conditions appears in at least 5 different, widely-used biomedical vocabularies: SNOMED CT, MeSH, Read Codes Clinical Terms, Psychology Ontology, PLOS Thesaurus, and FAST Topical Facet, with varying language for the concept (“weightlessness” vs. “zero gravity”). True semantic interoperability and data reusability that would permit a user to find all data tagged with this concept require either that all these concept instances be individually associated with the data, or use of a system that reliably maps all the concepts from these ever-changing, ever-expanding set of ontologies. Even if such metadata normalizing mechanisms are developed, their performance and value in generating “rich” metadata is dependent on the quality of input concepts supplied either by original data submitters or biodata curators (typically employed by the system). The expertise that submitters have is critical to shaping metadata that have value for many different kinds of audiences, and that allow associated data to be found and reused. In the biomedical field, submitters to shared data repositories have relatively low motivation to go to any great lengths to provide “rich metadata” (or assist biocurators in generating them). This is likely due, at least in part, to the fact that only a small fraction of shared data appears to be cited in publication references when they are reused.31 Without their input, niche repositories and data systems, like the GLDS, with limited resources for acquiring (and maintaining) rich metadata that meet all the criteria above must constantly trade the use of resources to acquire or generate rich metadata with those that could be used for other worthy goals. The findability and interoperability principles, when implemented in data systems, support data integration functions like multi-source data querying and retrieval. Principles F2, I1, I2, and R1.3 require the use of community-developed metadata standards, formal languages for metadata representation, FAIR vocabularies, and qualified references to other data. These principles are unfortunately not yet widely or fully implemented across biomedical data systems, making it difficult for systems to develop functions that integrate data semantically. To illustrate this, we examine our own experience developing the GLDS to provide federated search and retrieval of omics data from several data sources. We sought to import metadata records from three open-access data systems into our own metadata warehouse: GEO, MG-RAST, and the PRoteomics IDEntifications repository (PRIDE)5. Each of these systems defines metadata for omics data sets differently, but none of them make these schemas available in a formal semantic language format (such as RDF or OWL). Furthermore, there are no existing maps of any of the metadata schemas to each other. As such, we resorted to manually creating semantic maps of these schemas for use in our system; queries generated via the GLDS or its RESTful search API are executed against the mapped schema concepts, and matching records are shown in a common object model representation (Figure 4). While this approach met our immediate goals of allowing users to query several data sources using our system, it required a good deal of resources and domain expertise to develop a schema mapping. Furthermore, maintaining this mapping over time as each of the data sources inevitably change will require more of our limited resources. The research community should recognize the value of federated system functions like the querying function that the GLDS offers, and urge all open access repositories and data systems to make their metadata schemas available to all according to the aforementioned FAIR principles.",

    "abstract": "Background: Ionizing radiation from galactic cosmic rays (GCR) is one of the major risk factors that will impact the health of astronauts on extended missions outside the protective effects of the Earth’s magnetic field. The NASA GeneLab project has detailed information on radiation exposure using animal models with curated dosimetry information for spaceflight experiments. Methods: We analyzed multiple GeneLab omics datasets associated with both ground-based and spaceflight radiation studies that included in vivo and in vitro approaches. A range of ions from protons to iron particles with doses from 0.1 to 1.0 Gy for ground studies, as well as samples flown in low Earth orbit (LEO) with total doses of 1.0 mGy to 30 mGy, were utilized. Results: From this analysis, we were able to identify distinct biological signatures associating specific ions with specific biological responses due to radiation exposure in space. For example, we discovered changes in mitochondrial function, ribosomal assembly, and immune pathways as a function of dose. Conclusions: We provided a summary of how the GeneLab’s rich database of omics experiments with animal models can be used to generate novel hypotheses to better understand human health risks from GCR exposures.",
    "introduction": "Space is a hostile environment, and human space travel will entail effects at many levels of biological organization leading to related physiological effects. One of the major environmental factors in space is radiation. Ionizing radiation in space is composed of a complex mixture of particles including protons from the sun and galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) originating from outside the solar system. The GCR is composed of atomic nuclei, including a component of heavy charged and energetic (HZE) particles that are relatively few in number but highly ionizing. A major risk-factor for human spaceflight is exposure GCR HZE that can cause DNA damage that is unrepaired or mis-repaired [1]. Current research has shown measurable impact on in several areas affecting human health bone loss [2], skeletal muscle atrophy [3,4,5], reproductive hazards in women and men [6], cognitive/behavioral changes [7], central nervous system (CNS) decrements [8,9], and changes in cardiovascular physiology [10]. The possibility that space radiation exposure to increase cardiovascular disease risk requires additional validation similar to the ongoing observations of increased cardiac impairment observed in radiotherapy-treated cancer survivors [11,12]. Spaceflight has also been shown to have an impact on established cancer hallmarks [13], possibly increasing carcinogenic risk [14]. At the molecular level, space radiation from high energy photons and atomic nuclei can cause damage to cellular components, in particular deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). Damaged DNA, which is inadequately repaired, can led to mutations and chromosomal aberrations that have potential to propagate into RNA, potentially leading to cancer. Simulations using ground-based datasets representative of a combined space radiation and microgravity exposure have demonstrated that oxidative stress processes and mitochondrial dysfunctions are important contributors to biological effects from spaceflight. Simulated microgravity studies have demonstrated an inhibitory effect on cell cycle and cell proliferation [15]. These studies show the value of research centered on understanding the totality of space exposures [16]. A multitude of other biological processes that are affected include increased genomic instability and mutation rates [17], immune dysregulation [18], and deregulated cellular energetics [19]. Conflicting results on cellular stemness [20] have been reported with effects such as elongation of telomere and altered telomerase function that require clarification [21,22]. A substantial amount of work has also been generated in the area of omics. For several decades, omics animal-based studies have been performed to understand the human health risks due to spaceflight missions using the International Space Station, the space shuttle, biosatellites, and ground-based experiments. NASA’s growing GeneLab omics database now hosts almost 250 experimental studies on spaceflight exposure and analogous ground-based experiments from microbes, plants, animal models, and human/animal-derived cell cultures [23]. These data are available as an open-access resource for single- and multi-omic analyses on microarray, RNA-sequencing, bisulfite-sequencing, proteomic, metabolomic, and metagenomic datasets. Although these data are targeted to better understand the risks associated with human spaceflight, these experiments also demonstrate a unique stress that provides a better understanding of adverse human health effects due to alterations in cellular behavior owing to factors such as microgravity, altered carbon dioxide levels, psychological stressors, and damaging ionizing radiation exposures from GCR and protons in the Earth’s radiation belts. These datasets, and in particular the in vivo animal models used, present a unique experimental setting to study the cellular and host-level interactions that impact human health. In this study, a meta-analysis of these accumulated transcriptomic datasets in GeneLab relevant to spaceflight was undertaken to uncover potential dose-dependent biological responses that will help in understanding the human health risks experienced in the spaceflight environment. The studies identified were from human- and animal-derived tissues or cells exposed to protons and GCR HZEs at doses ranging from 0.1 to 1.0 Gy for ground studies and using samples flown to the International Space Station or shuttle missions with total doses between 1.0 and 30 mGy. Ground experiments are a well-established analog for space flight, but are limited in that they are relatively high dose, high dose rate, and in most cases use single particle species, in contrast to the low dose, low dose rate mixed radiation in space. Further work is needed to elucidate platform-dependent differences (mixed fields now being offered at the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory [24] are a step in this direction). The datasets were pooled and subjected to gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) to identify clusters of gene sets and associated biological processes. The results from this analysis highlight novel cellular responses that may be relevant contributors to the combined effects of microgravity and space radiation and therefore critical drivers of health risks from space radiation.",
    "results": "Using primarily in vivo animal models and their associated curated datasets available from the NASA GeneLab’s omics database, an examination of biological responses as a function of radiation dose was made using transcriptional and sequencing data. A total of 30 experimental conditions from 25 GeneLab Data System (GLDS) datasets were collected (Table 1). Multiple datasets were included from human or murine cell cultures or animal tissues from several anatomical sites (adrenal gland, blood, bone marrow, brain, breast, heart, cartilage, skin, eye, hair follicle, kidney, liver, lung, muscle, spleen, or thymus). For the simulated space radiation ground studies (GLDS-73, -80, -109, and -117) information related to energy, linear energy transfer (LET, a measure of energy deposition at the cellular and molecular scale), dose rate, particle charge, and particle mass are available and can be viewed in Table S1. The dose data for all spaceflight experiments, with the exception of GLDS-111, were from instruments available on the Space Shuttle and the International Space Station. Analysis was completed by subject matter experts from the Space Radiation Analysis Group (SRAG), Johnson Space Center, NASA. The provenance of data from GLDS-111 (Bion-M1) is detailed in the environmental data section of the GLDS for Bion-M1. The doses and dose rates for ground-based exposures are from the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory with uncertainties that are less than 2% [24].",
    "conclusion": "Here, we presented a novel approach in using publicly available transcriptomic data to determine potential health risks and dysregulation of biological pathways as a function of space radiation exposure. The use of NASA’s GeneLab platform [23] allowed us to mine data that might not have otherwise been possible to obtain from individual experimental datasets. The large number of radiation datasets available through this platform allowed the creative combination of different datasets from former experiments to generate new hypotheses [71]. Our hypothesis for this work suspected that there was a tissue independent dysregulation as a function of space radiation-absorbed dose that impacted key biological pathways associated with increased health risks such as induction of cancer. Because the GeneLab Data System contains spaceflight transcriptomic data from mice and tissues flown in low Earth orbit (LEO) for various time durations, we were able to obtain accumulated space radiation doses from 1 to 30 mGy. To obtain doses that will be more relevant to long-term deep space travel [7,14], we combined our analysis with simulated space radiation ground experiments performed in the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory (NSRL) at Brookhaven National Laboratory [24]. These experiments were performed on both mice and in vitro cell cultures with single ions (protons, 56Fe, and 26Si) at doses from 100 to 1000 mGy. By combining 25 GeneLab datasets over these doses, this work represents the first time a study has provided a comprehensive biological analysis and produced relevant and novel results indicating which relevant biological processes are being regulated as a function of space radiation exposure. These results may be further utilized to generate health risk assessment models and uncover potential targets for mitigation of space radiation effects via novel therapeutics. We chose to first look at the distribution of mapping errors within the RNA-sequencing results from liver samples by examining whether mice exposure to spaceflight resulted in detectable changes compared to ground controls. We chose to focus on liver tissue datasets from GeneLab with mice exposed to space radiation because on in the GLDS liver is the organ with the largest number of sequenced tissue thus far from rodent research missions [71]. This extremely novel analysis demonstrates how RNA-sequence data can be used to generate useful data other than the standard techniques to generate counts. With a cumulative exposure of 9.20 mGy for GLDS-168 mice, significant increases in A > G and C > T base substitutions were detected, as well as changes in CAC, CGT, GTA, or GTG error rates (Figure 1). However, there were no significant base-specific substitutions detected, and CAC, CGT, GTA, or GTG error rates all decreased significantly in GLDS-242 where mice received a cumulative dose of 8.03 mGy; however, due to the uncertainty inherent in the flight dosimetry, it was not possible to definitively determine whether this was the case. A major difference potentially impacting the observed differences between GLDS-168 and GLDS-242 was the animal sacrificing time at sample collection, which occurred during spaceflight for GLDS-168, but was 2 weeks after returning to Earth for GLDS-242. The recovery time for the mice after 2 weeks back on Earth might possibly allow recovery of the base substitutions and error rates observed during exposure to space radiation. The ability to detect single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in RNA and DNA datasets has been performed previously on the basis of the assumption of a homogeneous genomic sample for example from a tumor [70], whereas the sporadic and stochastic nature of HZE exposure is expected to result in random damage throughout the genome [72]. Therefore, approaches to map SNVs on the basis of bulk tissue approaches may not be able to account for the stochastic nature of the SNV damage accumulated in a tissue. Our interpretation of these results was that the spaceflight animals may have experienced more DNA damage/mutation than ground controls, but in the animals that were returned to Earth, the recovery of the animals allowed for repair to take place. Next, purely on the basis of statistical analysis, we were able to determine key biological functions that were being dysregulated as a function of space radiation. For example, in the C5 Gene Ontology (GO) terms (Figure 5C), ribosomal pathways were observed as decreasing with dose. Ribosomal assembly consisted of a number of ribosomal protein large (rpl) genes that are necessary in the assembly of the eukaryotic ribosome 60S subunit, as well as the ribosomal protein small genes involved 40S and/or 60S subunit assembly. Indeed, ribosome-related genes have been previously reported to be disrupted following exposure to ionizing radiation [73,74,75]. We observed a clear trend of increased activation of mitochondrial-related pathways in multiple different pathway databases, which include both the C5 GO terms (Figure 5C) and C2 curated gene sets (Figure 6C). Mitochondrial gene expression is susceptible to radiation-sensitivity [76]. A number of gene sets in these clusters showed dysregulation of the NADH: ubiquinone oxidoreductase (NDUF) gene family and mitochondria-related function, in agreement with effects of ionizing radiation on the mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes in previous studies [77,78,79]. This is especially relevant to human health, as the NASA Twins Study recently revealed mitochondrial stress and increased mitochondrial debris in the blood [21]. A distinct elicitation of inflammatory and immune-related cellular functions was also observed in this analysis with alteration in chemokine, cytokine, and interferon expression (Figure 5C and Figure 6C). Indeed, it has been very well appreciated that ionizing radiation exposure will cause both pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory expression as cellular signals attempt to resolve the unique normal tissue radiation injury that occurs both acutely and longer-term [80,81,82]. This immune signaling dysregulation has also been reported to occur when exposed to space radiation [83,84]. We also explored the potential cancer risk as a function of space radiation. The datasets we utilized for this study were from both in vitro and in vivo samples that did not have any cancer present and were not prone to induction of cancer. From our analysis, we observed several interesting results indicative of increased risk for the induction of cancer. In our analysis on the C6 Oncogenic Signature database, we observed that PDGF and TGFβ were clustered together, purely on the basis of the statistics, and both were decreasing with increasing dose (cluster 3 in Figure 7C). This observation is closely tied to previously established findings. In the literature, PDGF and TGFβ are closely related to cancer progression [85]. In addition, it has been shown in the clinic that decreases in PDGF and TGFβ levels after radiotherapy for breast cancer can cause echocardiographic alterations affecting cardiovascular morbidity [86]. We also observed the highest frequency of the KRAS pathway, a known oncogene [87], being impacted as a function dose (Figure 7A). It has been previously described in experiments with single ion species that KRAS can induce lung cancer due to HZE particles [14]. Our tissue-independent analysis did not demonstrate any significant induction of KRAS with increasing dose (cluster 1 in Figure 7C and Figure 8). This might indicate that either previous experiments done with single ions at higher HZE doses did not capture the dose-dependent trend in tissues, or when considering the full spectrum of ions at lower doses KRAS might not be the key driver in inducing tumor growth. Other oncogenic trends we observed were decreases in CSR, ESC, TGFβ, VEGFA, and mTOR C6 pathway levels as a function of increasing radiation dose (Figure 7 and Figure 8). TGFβ, VEGFa, and mTOR have all previously shown similar trends with increasing dose of simulated space radiation [32,88]. The ESC C6 term is refers to differentiation of embryonic stem cells (ESC) [89]. This rather surprising result indicates that increasing dose of space radiation reduces the efficiency of stem cell differentiation. It has been reported that after ionizing radiation exposure, mitochondria are heavily involved with stem cell development [90]. Exploiting these different pathway databases (i.e., GO, C2, and C6) provided key insights on how these different pathway trends are intertwined. The CSR C6 term refers to “common serum response” (CSR) specifically related to fibroblast serum [91]. Fibroblast serum response refers to factors released in the serum from fibroblasts involved in assisting with wound healing during tumorigenesis [91]. We can relate the decrease to the CSR pathways to what we observed in the GO analysis (cluster 3 in Figure 5) related to wound healing and VEGF pathways. We also observed with that wound healing should decrease with increasing doses of space radiation. This decrease can also reduce wound healing due to CSR and has shown that it can lead to tumorigenesis [91]. In addition, it has been reported that impairment occurs in space wound healing [92,93], and these data can potentially indicate an increased chance for tumor induction. These observed trends as a function of space radiation exposure revealed unique pathways that seem to be specifically related to GCR, whereas some pathways from our analysis are known to be universal responses to radiation. The mechanisms of damage are common to highly ionizing radiation regardless of the source [94]; what is unique to chronic space radiation exposure is the combination of highly ionizing particles, low dose, and a low dose rate, which may have implications for DNA repair [17], mitochondrial pathways [16], and lipid pathways [42] as just a few examples of what emerged from our analysis. In addition, we found specific cancer-related pathways that may be unique to space radiation. For example, decreases in TGFβ [32], embryonic stem cells (ESC) [95], and VEGFa seem to be unique to space radiation. Spaceflight studies have previously revealed a plethora of effects that radiation can have at individual doses or over a small range of discreet doses. However, the pooling and meta-analysis of these datasets in this study allowed for a unique visualization and comparison over a larger range of radiation doses. This in turn made it possible to identify trends in physiological response from low to high doses and provided insight into the response to accumulating doses that may occur in long duration space missions or over a few days during solar particle events. This technique may also be utilized to determine potential targets for therapeutic intervention. For example, because we report that mitochondrial pathways decrease as a function of space radiation, this argues for additional validation and research on specific mitochondrial targets for countermeasure development. In addition, from this analysis we can extrapolate to specific doses that may pose greater health risks. This analysis can only be done by utilizing a large number of datasets that are available from platforms such as NASA’s GeneLab. The resolution obtained from this analysis can easily be lost once we lower the number datasets that will be used. Our analysis has indicated several different health risks that may occur with increasing exposure to space radiation. Through an unbiased technique purely driven by statistics and utilizing a large amount of transcriptomic data from NASA’s GeneLab platform, we were able to identify tissue-independent biological pathways that are dysregulated as a function of space radiation dose. We believe this technique can further be used with other datasets and databases to generate more hypotheses that will assist with determining optimal therapeutic countermeasures and targets that can mitigate space radiation response in humans.",

    "abstract": "",
    "introduction": "Humans and vertebrate organisms exhibit a unique set of biological responses to the space environment, including bone and muscle atrophy (Burkhart et al., 2019; Gerbaix et al., 2017), immune dysfunction (Baqai et al., 2009), neurobehavioral changes (Ronca et al., 2019), vision impairment (Mader et al., 2011), and cardiovascular damage (Elgart et al., 2018). Ionizing radiation (IR) and microgravity are the main biological stressors in low-Earth orbit (LEO), which is the region encompassed by the Earth’s magnetosphere where all crewed missions currently occur. Although exposure to deep space radiation, which is primarily composed of galactic cosmic rays (GCRs), is reduced within LEO due to the magnetosphere, IR still poses a risk to astronauts in LEO, and GCRs are a critical health risk in the upcoming lunar and Mars missions (Townsend, 2005). Thus, combining LEO experiments with ground-based analogs of spaceflight stressors, including simulated GCRs, allows investigations into the mechanisms behind biological responses to spaceflight. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short (~22 nucleotides long) sequences of non-coding RNA that can regulate gene expression at the transcriptional and translational level and interact directly with proteins (Vanderburg and Beheshti, 2020). miRNAs have been implicated as predictors and regulators for several diseases, including cancer (Macfarlane and Murphy, 2010), neurodegenerative diseases (Konovalova et al., 2019), and autoimmune disorders (Chen et al., 2016). miRNAs have also been found to be involved in biological responses to both microgravity (Girardi et al., 2014) and IR (Simone et al., 2009). Therefore, identifying miRNAs (and their networks) that are shared between humans and model organisms in response to spaceflight stressors could reveal targets for biomarker and countermeasure development to reduce the associated health risks. Previously, we used spaceflown rodent RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) datasets from the NASA GeneLab database to make unbiased predictions about miRNAs potentially involved in regulating the transcriptional response to spaceflight (Beheshti et al., 2018). The datasets analyzed in that study are described in the STAR Methods. Our analysis identified a set of 13 spaceflight-associated miRNAs that were predicted to drive a systemic response and suggested transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 as an overarching regulator of their expression (Beheshti et al., 2018). TGF-β1 is a major regulatory cytokine mediating the progression of cancer (Rooke and Crosier, 2001), autoimmunity (Marie et al., 2006), and neuroinflammation (Cekanaviciute et al., 2014). However, it is important to note that this spaceflight-associated miRNA signature was defined computationally, based on transcriptomic analysis, and not measured experimentally. Here, we experimentally validated the predicted spaceflight-associated miRNA signature by quantifying circulating miRNAs in serum from rodents exposed to simulated spaceflight conditions: microgravity, partial gravity, LEO-relevant IR, simulated deep space radiation, and combined exposures to reduced gravity and simulated space radiation, as well as true spaceflight in LEO. We supported spaceflight-stressor-mediated changes in the expression of the predicted miRNAs by performing agnostic miRNA-seq in selected datasets, and our experimental validation also incorporated simulated deep space radiation conditions to help evaluate the extent to which the miRNA signature may be shared by different space environments. Finally, we addressed the human relevance of our findings by analyzing miRNAs released by irradiated human immune cells ex vivo and miRNA expression changes in astronauts from the NASA Twins Study in vivo (Garrett-Bakelman et al., 2019). We expanded our initial panel of 13 candidate miRNAs (Beheshti et al., 2018) to include 15 target miRNAs with the following justifications: (1) miRNA let-7 was subdivided into two more specific family members (let-7a and let-7c) identified in recent space biology studies (Režen et al., 2014; Wei et al., 2018), and (2) an additional miRNA (miR-92a) was added after analyzing astronaut data from the NASA Twins Study. Furthermore, we investigated the potential downstream effects of spaceflight-associated human miRNAs using single-cell RNA (scRNA) sequencing of a targeted gene panel of leukocyte-depleted fractions in the NASA Twins Study (Garrett-Bakelman et al., 2019). Specifically, we compared gene expression in cells collected within 3 days upon spaceflown twin’s (TW) return to his preflight and postflight samples, as well as control samples taken from the ground control twin (HR). Single-cell transcriptomics also let us determine the individual cell types that display the strongest perturbations in gene expression consistent with miRNA signatures identified in bulk transcriptomics, and single-cell assay for transposase accessible chromatin (scATAC) sequencing data were used to delineate chromatin changes that may have altered the accessibility of the spaceflight-associated miRNAs.",

    "conclusion": "In summary, we have validated the previously predicted panel of candidate spaceflight-relevant miRNAs using a combination of spaceflight, simulated microgravity, partial gravity, and simulated deep space radiation conditions in male and female mouse and rat in vivo, astronaut, and human ex vivo models. The majority of rodent serum miRNAs followed the pattern of dose-dependent increase in response to IR, with the notable exception of miR-217 (Figures 7D and 7E). We evaluated the applicability of this miRNA signature to humans by examining miRNA content in the supernatant of primary human immune cell samples exposed to simulated deep space radiation, as well as immune cells from the NASA Twins Study, and observed partial conservation across species. The functional significance of key miRNAs was predicted by analyzing miRNA-dependent changes in gene expression at the single-cell level in the NASA Twins Study and experimentally evaluated utilizing antagomirs to mitigate vascular damage caused by simulated deep space radiation in a 3D human microvascular tissue model. When viewing these results independently, it may appear that some level of variability occurs for the miRNA between the different conditions (Figures 1, 2, 3, and 4), but when observing all conditions together, this variability is in fact accounted for, based on which component of the space environment is being observed. A summary of how all the miRNA patterns and downstream targets demonstrate the consistency over all the models utilized for this study is shown in Figures 7D and 7E. For example, certain miRNAs (e.g., let-7a-5p, let-7c-5p, miR-223-3p) are more significantly regulated with microgravity experiments as opposed space radiation experiments, while other miRNAs (e.g., miR-16-5p) are consistently being expressed in all conditions (Figure 7D). Collectively, our samples identify two spaceflight miRNA signatures, the first associated with reduced gravity and LEO and the second representing the responses to simulated deep space radiation. Specifically, gamma-irradiated mice, sham HU mice, PWB rats, ISS-flown mice, and the Twins Study data collectively display a LEO/microgravity miRNA signature, while 600 MeV/n 56Fe and proton-irradiated mice, human PBMCs, and human 3D microvascular tissue models exposed to 600 MeV/n 56Fe ions and simplified simulated GCRs show a deep-space-radiation-dependent signature (Figure 7D). Notably, significant overlaps exist between both signatures, indicating a miRNA panel that might be particularly relevant to future lunar and Mars missions that will combine both stressors. The absence of significant differences in miRNA-217 expression in these datasets serves as a negative control and demonstrates that the responses that had been observed in the remaining candidate miRNAs are unlikely to be caused by universal miRNA increases induced by an arbitrary stressor. A miRNA signature unique to the spaceflight response has potential uses as a biomarker of systemic biological damage as well as a source for targets for mitigating the health risks caused by spaceflight and deep space radiation. While specific miRNAs have previously been implicated in spaceflight-associated biological damage (Girardi et al., 2014; Simone et al., 2009; Teodori et al., 2019), recent systems biology studies indicate that using an entire miRNA network as a biomarker can provide a more robust association with biological changes (Beheshti et al., 2017). In addition, we have observed that individual components of the space environment have unique miRNA signatures: some miRNAs are associated with the microgravity component of real or simulated spaceflight, others are associated with exposure to deep space radiation, and still others are only significantly increased after exposure to both, suggesting that different miRNA-based biomarkers would be applicable to different conditions, with the latter being particularly important in deep space exploration. The sensitivity of miRNA responses is underscored by the fact that the magnitude of miRNA increases appears to be dose dependent for both radiation and microgravity, as observed in the mouse simulated space environment model and the PWB rat model, respectively. Similarly, for the IR component, the signature is also LET dependent, as we report more significant miRNA changes after 600 MeV/n 56Fe compared to proton or gamma irradiation, which suggests its potential relevance for future deep space missions. Finally, conserved increases of key miRNAs across species, sexes, and experiments emphasizes the reliability of the miRNA signature. Since the majority of the data in this paper are from males, there can be sex-specific differences that are not captured here. It has been shown that certain miRNAs and family members of miRNAs are significantly expressed in one sex over the other, in normal and cancerous (e.g., The Cancer Genome Atlas) tissues (Guo et al., 2017). For example, miR-503 is linked to female-related cardiovascular disease (Florijn et al., 2018), indicating that miRNAs in the same family have similar behaviors in different sexes while still linked to the original family of miRNAs. Future research will need to explore the sex differences and the spaceflight signatures for specific miRNAs as well as related miRNA family members. Of note, miRNA signatures may be applied for improving astronaut health by providing the first step toward identifying a network of circulating regulatory molecules that are activated by spaceflight. Identifying, validating and targeting such systemic regulatory networks, as opposed to addressing symptomatic damage in isolated organs and tissues, may accelerate our ability to mitigate the damage to several organ systems at once. Additionally, this approach may be used for preemptive risk reduction. Indeed, we experimentally demonstrated the countermeasure potential of miRNAs by using antagomirs to inhibit three miRNAs associated with spaceflight cardiovascular health risks in human 3D tissue models. In general, antagomirs are a powerful tool for preventing the downstream effects of miRNA, which can be extensive due to the ability of a single miRNA to interact with hundreds of genes at the transcriptional, translational, and protein levels (Krützfeldt et al., 2005). Antagomirs have been shown to effectively inhibit their miRNA targets in vivo in mouse models of disease; however, more research is required for understanding their off-target effects and tissue specificity (Ishida and Selaru, 2013). In our model, antagomirs were applied as a countermeasure prior to deep-space-relevant irradiation and successfully prevented microvascular damage. Thus, our suggested network of miRNAs and their implied targets not only provides mechanistic insight into spaceflight-induced organ damage, but also may be a valuable platform for preventing the adverse health effects of spaceflight. However, in our experiments, the antagomir therapy was only applied against the cardiovascular component of the miRNA signature due to the model only recapitulating human microvasculature. It would be important to measure the effects of miRNA inhibition of the rest of the miRNA signature in a model that more fully captures spaceflight-mediated immune dysfunction and cancer progression as well as in vivo. The panel of spaceflight-associated miRNAs has been predicted to disrupt cell signaling and metabolic pathways, at least in part via their interactions with TGF-β1 (Beheshti et al., 2018). TGF-β1 is a pleiotropic cytokine that has been shown previously to be significantly modulated during spaceflight conditions (Jessup et al., 2000; Westerlind and Turner, 1995), and its expression has been successfully altered as a therapeutic approach in cancer and inflammation. However, TGF-β1 is involved in a wide variety of endothelial and immune cell processes, which makes it a risky target (Otten et al., 2010). Furthermore, given that TGF-β1 has been found to exert both tumor-suppressive and tumor-promoting effects at different stages of tumorigenesis (Ikushima and Miyazono, 2010), the ability of miRNAs to target the TGF-β1 pathway at multiple specific sites may suggest a more effective and dynamic modulation of TGF-β1 effects than simple overexpression or inhibition (Butz et al., 2012). Thus, antagomir-mediated miRNA inhibition may allow more context-specific TGF-β1 pathway modulation and may be a promising countermeasure for spaceflight applications as well. The interactions between the proposed miRNA candidates and TGF-β1 have important consequences for inflammation during different stages of spaceflight, particularly during landing. miR-145 and miR-146a, which are both associated with a pro-inflammatory response (Tahamtan et al., 2018), have been found to be increased during landing (Capri et al., 2019). miR-21, which is involved in the resolution of inflammation (Tahamtan et al., 2018), has been found to be decreased during spaceflight (Hughes-Fulford et al., 2015; Makedonas et al., 2018) and increased during landing (Capri et al., 2019). Changes in these miRNAs during different stages of spaceflight likely contribute to the overall dysregulation of inflammation, which may persist long after astronauts return to Earth (Garrett-Bakelman et al., 2019) In general, miRNAs have yet to be studied extensively in the context of space biology. Previous rodent and human spaceflight (LEO) experiments that specifically examined miRNAs have been limited to in vitro cellular models (human fibroblasts and leukocytes), though some miRNAs (miR-34, miR-21, let-7a, and let-7c) identified in those studies do overlap with our proposed spaceflight signature (Hughes-Fulford et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2016). Simulated microgravity studies in humans undergoing 21-day bedrest have also reported let-7a, let-7c, miR-25, miR-125b, and miR-92a from our panel (Rullman et al., 2016). Finally, simulated deep space radiation studies in mice have implicated miR-34 and miR-125 (Templin et al., 2012), which we have also observed in irradiated mouse serum. Further studies will be necessary to compare spaceflight-associated miRNA effects at the individual organ, tissue, and cellular levels and to explore potential sex differences. Although we have observed strong similarities in miRNA expression in cardiac and soleus muscles (Figures 7D and 7E), the miRNA content in these organs was not sufficient to explain the systemic changes in plasma miRNAs, indicating that other organs and tissues not quantified in this study may play a major role in miRNA expression. Therefore, there is a need for a more comprehensive and unbiased assessment of all miRNA through miRNA-seq in a wide range of tissues from each of the experimental models investigated here. In addition, scRNA-seq has indicated major changes in miRNA-associated gene expression among different blood immune cell types in the human blood from the NASA Twins Study (Gertz et al., 2020). CD14+ monocytes are particularly likely to express and respond to miRNAs, suggesting a potential regulatory role of miRNAs on the innate immune response that is known to be dysregulated in spaceflight (Crucian et al., 2011). Despite the demonstrated contribution of CD14+ monocytes to increases in the circulating miRNAs, it is also possible that the miRNAs could be coming from another organ where they are more abundantly expressed. Thus, further studies will be necessary to determine the exact origin of the increased miRNAs and tissue response, such as with cell-free DNA profiling (Bezdan et al., 2020), which will be beneficial for mapping and developing effective countermeasures. Finally, the successful prevention of vascular damage through antagomir therapy in our proof-of-concept human tissue model demonstrates the need for further experiments to fully characterize antagomir therapies in vivo to understand their clinical safety and efficacy and to examine which components of the spaceflight miRNA signature make effective targets for antagomir therapies. Collectively, our results provide experimental confirmation of a previously predicted spaceflight-associated miRNA signature (Beheshti et al., 2018) in multiple rodent and human models in true spaceflight, simulated gravitational changes, and simulated deep space radiation. We also demonstrate the potential for preventing biological damage by strategic inhibition of specific miRNAs with antagomirs. The immediate impact of this study is the first step toward developing a systemic miRNA signature as a novel space biology research metric for assessing spaceflight-induced damage in astronauts and animal models of true spaceflight as well as ground analogs, while its expected long-term outcome is revealing new avenues for spaceflight countermeasure development that modulates systemic effects rather than isolated organ damage.",

    "link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9400218/",
    "abstract": "",
    "introduction": "Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) has a detrimental impact on human health on Earth and it is equally concerning in other environments such as space habitat due to microgravity, radiation and confinement, especially for long-distance space travel. The International Space Station (ISS) is ideal for investigating microbial diversity and virulence associated with spaceflight. The shotgun metagenomics data of the ISS generated during the Microbial Tracking–1 (MT-1) project and resulting metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) across three flights in eight different locations during 12 months were used in this study. The objective of this study was to identify the AMR genes associated with whole genomes of 226 cultivable strains, 21 shotgun metagenome sequences, and 24 MAGs retrieved from the ISS environmental samples that were treated with propidium monoazide (PMA; viable microbes).",
    "results": "We have analyzed the data using a deep learning model, allowing us to go beyond traditional cut-offs based only on high DNA sequence similarity and extending the catalog of AMR genes. Our results in PMA treated samples revealed AMR dominance in the last flight for Kalamiella piersonii, a bacteria related to urinary tract infection in humans. The analysis of 226 pure strains isolated from the MT-1 project revealed hundreds of antibiotic resistance genes from many isolates, including two top-ranking species that corresponded to strains of Enterobacter bugandensis and Bacillus cereus. Computational predictions were experimentally validated by antibiotic resistance profiles in these two species, showing a high degree of concordance. Specifically, disc assay data confirmed the high resistance of these two pathogens to various beta-lactam antibiotics.",
    "conclusion": "Overall, our computational predictions and validation analyses demonstrate the advantages of machine learning to uncover concealed AMR determinants in metagenomics datasets, expanding the understanding of the ISS environmental microbiomes and their pathogenic potential in humans.",

    "link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9267413/",
    "abstract": "Outer space is an extremely hostile environment for human life, with ionizing radiation from galactic cosmic rays and microgravity posing the most significant hazards to the health of astronauts. Spaceflight has also been shown to have an impact on established cancer hallmarks, possibly increasing carcinogenic risk. Terrestrially, women have a higher incidence of radiation-induced cancers, largely driven by lung, thyroid, breast, and ovarian cancers, and therefore, historically, they have been permitted to spend significantly less time in space than men. In the present review, we focus on the effects of microgravity and radiation on the female reproductive system, particularly gynecological cancer. The aim is to provide a summary of the research that has been carried out related to the risk of gynecological cancer, highlighting what further studies are needed to pave the way for safer exploration class missions, as well as postflight screening and management of women astronauts following long-duration spaceflight.",
    "introduction": "Human spaceflight and deep space exploration are the aspirational activities of numerous national space agencies including the European Space Agency (ESA), Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA), National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and Canadian Space Agency (CSA), as well as many commercial and other private entities. Studies to determine the long-term physiological responses and adaptation to the space environment and further re-adaptation to the environmental conditions on Earth are of crucial importance to the safety and health of the astronauts [1]. Beyond the stressors of getting to space, such as vibration and acceleration forces, microgravity and radiation are the most significant hazards during space travel [2]. There are other sources of physiological and psychological stress during spaceflight, including circadian shifting, dietary alterations, confined spaces, and isolation [2]. The impact of spaceflight and the cosmic environment on those organ systems essential to carry out tasks in space (motor skills, cardiovascular system, and maintenance of overall bodily function) and which are essential upon return to Earth, have received the majority of focus as they relate to studies of astronaut health and wellbeing. A long-standing concern has also been the effects of the cosmic environment on male and female reproductive health including carcinogenesis of the primary reproductive organs secondary to cosmic radiation exposure. However, this area of research lags behind. Advances in molecular biology, genetics, oncology and radiotherapy have provided more insights in recent years [2]; however, there is a paucity of research evaluating the risks of gynecological cancers, ovarian insufficiency, or infertility following spaceflight. In the present review, we focus on the effects of microgravity and radiation on the female reproductive system, particularly gynecological cancer. The aim is to provide a summary of what is known so far from studies conducted on Earth, together with the research questions and challenges requiring further study to pave the way for safer exploration class missions, as well as postflight screening and management of female astronauts following long-duration spaceflight.",
    "results": "",
    "conclusion": "The current data reveal a scarcity of knowledge about the impact of space radiation and microgravity on gynecologic cancer, as there have been insufficient numbers of female astronauts exposed to long-duration, low-dose rate, and proton and heavy ion radiation to reliably determine the impact on the female reproductive system. With the upcoming Artemis missions set to place the first females on the Moon, there will be longer duration of exposures to both microgravity and space radiation; hence, the influence of flight length on risks related to gynecological cancers will demand a larger focus in ensuring astronaut safety during flight and postflight. Indeed, among all body tissues, the male and female gonads are among the most sensitive to radiation. Therefore, these tissues may be one of the best to study to determine space radiation related exposures.",

    "abstract": "",
    "introduction": "The presence of humans in space has considerably increased since the beginning of space conquest and the space population is expected to continue to grow with tourism and private research activities. The NASA Artemis program plans to take humans back to the Moon for 2024, and a walk on Mars soil is estimated in the course of the 2030s (Bukley, 2020). Meanwhile, space research is driving more and more astronauts in low Earth orbit as an invaluable tool used to deepen humanity’s understanding of the universe and our place within it. But not only do humans want to visit and explore space, humans want to live in space. Outer space settlement has become a new goal of space agencies and the private sector. The Artemis program, SpaceX, the Moon Village Association, and the Mars Society are examples of the driving force of human performance in space. Recently, the USA Air Force Space Command reported eight most plausible scenarios to the year 2060, all of which anticipating a permanent occupation of the Moon surface ranging from a small-sized crew to colony of thousands of people (Air Force Space Command, 2019). Over fifty years after the first foot imprint on the lunar surface, humans could very soon become an interplanetary species. This endeavor is hampered by space stressors such as space radiation, microgravity, confinement, isolation, hostile conditions, and distance from Earth, that all induce physiological changes (Afshinnekoo et al., 2020). These changes can be seen as physiological adaptation to the space environment, but they can become maladaptive and deleterious over time and upon gravity re-exposure during a planetary mission such as to Mars. Nine major spaceflight systemic and physiological health risks have been identified: cardiovascular dysregulation, central nervous system impairment, increased cancer risk, muscle degeneration, bone loss, liver dysfunction and lipid dysregulation, circadian rhythm dysregulation, immune dysfunction, and space-associated neuro-ocular syndrome (SANS) (Afshinnekoo et al., 2020). Muscle atrophy is a major risk for these missions as it impairs mobility, thus compromising critical mission operations such as post-landing vehicle egress. Muscle atrophy is characterized by unbalanced protein degradation and the loss of muscle mass. However, protein supplementation fails to counteract muscle loss in sarcopenia, cachexia, and spaceflight-induced muscle atrophy (Gao and Chilibeck, 2020). Many studies have documented spaceflight-induced muscle atrophy as a consequence of weightlessness and decreased muscle solicitation (Fitts et al., 2000). Daily exercises as countermeasures succeed in slowing down the process but the muscle still shrinks during missions. Despite the important advances in human physiology in space, the molecular mechanisms underlying these physiological changes are poorly understood. Therefore, molecular analyses are needed to enable a new countermeasure approach to monitor astronaut health and ensure safety of future habited space missions. The liver and the muscle are among the most affected tissues during spaceflight. The liver and the muscle are two master organs of the metabolism, with the muscle tissue representing up to 50% of the total body mass. Consistently, astronauts and living organisms exposed to space environment display many features of dysregulated metabolism. Rats on the SpaceLab-2 mission displayed increased serum cholesterol levels (Popova et al., 1999). In mice, activated lipotoxic pathways are associated with abnormal liver lipid accumulation and increased lipid metabolism and lipid localization gene expression (Jonscher et al., 2016; Beheshti et al., 2019). Beheshti et al. recently showed using a multi-omic analysis that lipid dysregulation in mice liver and lipotoxic pathways was a specific response to space stressors alone (Beheshti et al., 2019). Dysregulated lipid metabolism, especially lipid accumulation, is strongly associated with non-alcoholic fatty acid liver diseases (NAFLD), liver dysfunction, insulin resistance (IR), and diabetes (Kovacs and Stumvoll, 2005; Perry et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2010). Of note, mice showed early signs of liver injury on a short space flight (STS-135), and subclinical diabetogenic changes have been shown to occur during spaceflight and bedrest studies (Jonscher et al., 2016; Tobin et al., 2002). In mice flown aboard the BION-M1 biosatellite, the transcriptome response of the longissimus dorsi was mainly linked to metabolism, especially insulin signaling and sensitivity, highlighting the impact of spaceflight on glucose metabolism in skeletal muscle (Gambara et al., 2017a). Glucagon and insulin, two hormones of glucose metabolism, were predicted to be the common upstream regulators of spaceflight metabolic shift (Beheshti et al., 2019). In the Twin Study, increased levels of lactic acid were found in the urine of the flight astronaut, consistent with metabolomics data showing an increased lactic acid/pyruvic acid ratio suggesting a metabolic shift (Garrett-Bakelman et al., 2019). Interestingly, insulin resistance and liver diseases are associated with muscle atrophy and a potential reciprocal influence of insulin resistance and muscle disuse atrophy (Chakravarthy et al., 2020; Meyer et al., 2020; Rudrappa et al., 2016; Samuel and Shulman, 2012). As such, metabolic stress is a priority research for human space exploration (Bergouignan et al., 2016). The roles of the liver and the muscle are often interlinked, and muscle-liver crosstalk are described in metabolic diseases NAFLD, NASH, IR, and diabetes (Chakravarthy et al., 2020; Soeters and Soeters, 2012). However, the relationship of the two organs in the response to space environment has not been yet elucidated. In this study, we describe for the first time the relationship of the response of both the liver and the muscle of mice during spaceflight using the R software package mixOmics widely used in the omic field. The mixOmics package enables datasets comparison, correlations, and associations visualization in various research areas (Duruflé et al., 2021; González et al., 2012).",
    "results": "",
    "conclusion": "Despite the systemic and physiological health risk of spaceflight, it is a fact that humans have become a space-faring species. Muscle atrophy has been shown to occur in both weightlessness and bed rest studies. The decreased gravity load on the locomotive apparatus is often presented as the main driver of muscle atrophy and bone loss. Previous studies showed that mitochondrial function and lipid metabolism were impaired in both astronauts and mice during spaceflight. Da Silveira and colleagues previously showed that a mitochondrial stress is a central hub for spaceflight-induced physiological changes (da Silveira et al., 2020). Mitochondria are complex organelles inside the cell where fundamental biomolecules are metabolized through the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) and coupled to energy production by the electron transport chain. Thus, mitochondria play a key role in metabolism and energy management. Here, we found that lipid metabolism is the most affected biological process between the quadriceps and the liver transcriptome in mice during spaceflight. Impaired lipid metabolism and fatty acid accumulation is associated with muscle atrophy. Of note, butanoate and propanoate metabolism were the most affected in the two organs analyzed, decreased in the liver while increased in the muscle. Butanoate and propanoate, also known as butyrate and propionate, are short chain fatty acids produced in the intestinal lumen by bacterial fermentation of undigested carbohydrates, especially resistant starch, dietary fiber, and to a lesser extent proteins. Resistant starch is found in some grains, beans, and legumes. The gut microbiome is disturbed during spaceflight; astronauts’ gut microbiome showed an alteration in the composition pattern of bacteria of the phylum Firmicutes, the main butyrate-producing bacteria in the human gut (Venegas et al., 2019), with the presence of different genus increasing or decreasing during spaceflight but also showing a consistent decrease in bacteria from the taxa Pseudobutyrivibrio and Akkermansia, also known to produce butyrate in the intestine (Garrett-Bakelman et al., 2019; Voorhies et al., 2019; Venegas et al., 2019). Microbiome analysis from RR1 mice showed an overall increase of bacteria of the phylum Firmicutes, but the authors linked that to similar alterations that occur with aging (Jiang et al., 2019). This Firmicute increase in older mice is seen as a sign of dysbiosis and this alteration was shown to be followed by a ∼70% decrease in butyrate levels (Spychala et al., 2018). The upregulation of butyrate and propionate pathways in the muscle can reflect a possible need for these fatty acids and derivatives. In this context, dietary changes could represent a feasible countermeasure to spaceflight-induced physiological changes. The TCA cycle activity and the glycolysis/gluconeogenesis ratio are decreased in muscle during spaceflight suggesting disturbed energy production. Consistently, we found that spaceflight induced a hyperglycemic response in mouse muscle involving the downregulation of hypoglycemic signaling pathways downstream of the insulin receptor (HIF, ErbB, AMPK, FoxO, and PI3K-Akt). This signaling response mostly affected glucose import gene expression. In addition, high energy demand processes such as DNA repair, autophagy, and translation gene expression were decreased in inflight mice quadriceps, suggesting a shift toward an energy-saving mode in the muscle during spaceflight. The muscle is a high energy demand organ. Since the muscle represent up to 50% of the total body mass, its metabolism radically affects glucose availability in the body. Consequently, glucose sparing and energy saving by the muscle in detrimental conditions can compensate for the energy needs of other such as the brain that requires stable and continuous glucose supply. Oxidative stress and DNA damage overload, that can impair mitochondrial function and the metabolism, are examples of detrimental conditions occurring during spaceflight (Afshinnekoo et al., 2020; Garrett-Bakelman et al., 2019). Also, mitochondrial dysfunction has been linked to muscle atrophy (Abrigo et al., 2019). The HIF-1 signaling enriched pathways suggest that oxidative stress occurred in RR1 inflight mice. Oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction promote insulin resistance and diabetes (Bashan et al., 2009; Di Meo et al., 2017; Sivitz and Yorek, 2010). Our results, in line with previous space studies, suggest an insulin resistance phenotype. Meanwhile, insulin resistance has been proposed as an evolutionary mechanism to spare glucose that can benefit survival in various states such as starvation, immune activation growth, and cancer (Soeters and Soeters, 2012). Insulin resistance and diabetes are often associated with dysregulated lipid metabolism and liver diseases. Fatty acids inhibit the insulin signaling pathways by directly interfering in the signaling through diacylglycerol or by overloading the TCA with the precursor acetyl CoA (Kovacs and Stumvoll, 2005; Perry et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2010). During spaceflight, liver lipid metabolic gene expression correlated with muscle glucose import gene expression in RR1 mice. Insulin resistance, NAFLD, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), and cirrhosis are associated with muscle atrophy and their severity correlates positively (Chakravarthy et al., 2020; Meyer et al., 2020; Samuel and Shulman, 2012). During a stress starvation, fatty acids together with ketone bodies become the primary source of energy for cells while peripheral organs such as the muscle, but also the skin and bones, provide amino acids taken up by central organs such as the liver, the spleen, immune cells, and healing tissues, ultimately leading to protein loss (Soeters and Soeters, 2012). During a spaceflight, all cells are exposed to space stressors such as radiation, endocrine system perturbation induced by altered circadian rhythm or psychological issues, and microgravity, all promoting oxidative stress, DNA damage, and mitochondrial dysfunction. In addition, it has been shown that spaceflight induces a shift from slow aerobic and highly enriched mitochondria muscle fibers (“slow fiber”, “type I”) toward fast anaerobic and fast low-enriched mitochondria muscle fiber (“fast fiber”, “type II”) (Gambara et al., 2017b; Ulanova et al., 2015). Mitochondria are the major source of reactive oxygen species. As such, spaceflight-induced fiber shift and mitochondrial dysfunction can be seen as a biological mechanism to decrease mitochondrial activity and mitigate oxidative stress. If mitochondrial stress is a central biological hub during spaceflight, and if the mitochondria are the master organelle of metabolism regulation and energy management, we can then expect a general metabolic shift in the body toward a starvation-like phenotype that promotes decreased mitochondrial activity, decreased metabolism and protein loss in the muscle, and increased lipid metabolism in the liver, to the benefit of all body cells during spaceflight. Consistently, liver lipid metabolism gene expression strongly correlated with muscle DNA repair, autophagy, translation, and finally muscle atrophy phenotype gene expression. Butanoate and propanoate metabolism-related genes were still among the one with the strongest correlation. Interestingly, sodium butyrate and butyrate diet supplementation improve mitochondrial function, fat accumulation, insulin resistance, diabetes, and liver diseases (Gao et al., 2009; Khan and Jena, 2016; Mollica et al., 2017; Ye et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2019; Zhou et al., 2018). Moreover, sodium butyrate and butyrate diet supplementation decreased muscle atrophy in various conditions (Chang et al., 2001; Tang et al., 2022; Walsh et al., 2015). Thus, butyrate supplementation or dietary modification to stimulate microbial production represents simple options to counteract muscle atrophy while preventing insulin resistance and lipid accumulation during spaceflight. Gambara et al. previously identified insulin- and glucose metabolism-linked transcripts as main DEG in BION-M1 biosatellite flown mice longissimus dorsi. In the present study, 17 and 13 differentially expressed genes in the liver and the muscle, respectively, were common to the 89 previously identified (Gambara et al., 2017a). Acas1a, Cpt2, Agt, Lcn2, and Prkcd, which were among the most DEG in Gambara’s study were not found significantly differentially expressed neither in the liver nor the quadriceps in the present study. The present study is based on the analyses of discriminating genes identified by the spls-DA performed with the mixOmics script. This method is designed to identify variations that are correlated, here gene expression in the liver and gene expression in the quadriceps. Also, 31 over the 9753, among which Agt and Cpt2, and 24 over the 3463 discriminating genes in the liver and the quadriceps, respectively, were in common with the 89 of the Gambara’s study. These differences may reflect the variability of gene expression between the different muscle types. Nonetheless, in line with the literature, both converge to an altered insulin transcriptome, thus highlighting a general adaptive response in muscle during spaceflight despite different molecular pathways. Moreover, the present study highlights the importance of discriminating genes over DEG in deciphering omic data. We found that discriminating genes are mainly linked to lipid metabolism in the liver and insulin signaling and glucose metabolism in the quadriceps. This means that lipid metabolism gene expression in the liver correlates with insulin signaling and glucose metabolism gene expression in the quadriceps in mice during spaceflight. We identified a cluster of lipid metabolism processes-related genes in the liver, including Akr1c12, Ces1c, Abcg8, Abcg5, Fabp2, Apom, Rdh7, Serpina6, Gpat2, and Slc10a1, correlating the most with glucose transport gene expression and potentially insulin resistance in the muscle. Among these genes, some are already described for their insulin sensitivity. Fabp2, Abcg5, and Abcg8 genes polymorphisms are associated with insulin sensitivity while Apom might protect against insulin resistance (Gylling et al., 2004; Kurano et al., 2020; Weiss et al., 2002; Yu et al., 2020). Interestingly, Sestrin 1 (Sesn1), a well-known regulator of cell metabolism upregulated in longissimus dorsi of BION-M1 mice, was reported as a discriminating gene in both the liver and the quadriceps (Gambara et al., 2017a). Sestrin proteins are involved in the metabolism of reactive oxygen species, autophagy, and insulin signaling (Lee et al., 2013). Sesn1 together with the present lipid metabolism-related gene cluster may thus account in insulin resistance research. The liver influence on quadriceps gene expression we identified needs to be carried out by organ communication mechanisms and we identified hepatokines as the most likely effector. Hepatokines are proteins secreted by the liver that can modulate signaling pathways associated with energy metabolism in the muscle and influence the development of chronic metabolic diseases (Seo et al., 2021). Important for our context, an increased blood concentration of FGF21, ANGPTL4, FST, and Andropin increases insulin sensitivity, muscle hypertrophy, and mitochondrial function and diminishes fat mass in the muscle (Seo et al., 2021). Interestingly, increased concentration of Fetuin-A showed to have the inverse effect of the previously described hepatokines (Jensen-Cody and Potthoff, 2021; Seo et al., 2021). The levels of Fetuin-A increase after 60 day of bed rest, a ground model for microgravity effects, and we found in the literature a positive correlation between the Fetuin-A levels and the gene expression of Serpina6 and Rdh7, two genes we identified in our gene cluster (Herrmann et al., 2020; Thakur et al., 2008; Ward et al., 2020). Interestingly, Fetuin-A, as well as FGF21 and ANGPTL4 genes are among the correlating genes in the liver of mice during spaceflight reported by the liver versus quadriceps sPLS-DA. We hypothesize that the gene expression correlation identified in our work likely involves an increased Fetuin-A production by the liver and a diminished production of FGF21, ANGPTL4, FST, and Andropin. In conclusion, we described for the first time a strong correlation between liver lipid metabolism gene expression and the downregulation of hypoglycemic and energy demand process-related genes. In the light of current knowledge, our result suggests that a starvation-like phenotype could promote a metabolic shift toward an energy-saving mode, resource sparring, and lipid mobilization through a tight liver-muscle crosstalk contributing to muscle atrophy during spaceflight. Dietary changes based on starch supplementation and microbiome modulation represent an affordable and sustainable countermeasure to support our planetary goals and outer space settlement. Meanwhile, improving food habits and body energy monitoring is an overall human challenge both on Earth and beyond.",

    "title": "Chromosomal positioning and epigenetic architecture influence DNA methylation patterns triggered by galactic cosmic radiation",
    "link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10789781/",
    "abstract": "Despite surging interest in space travel in recent decades, the impacts of prolonged, elevated exposure to galactic cosmic radiation (GCR) on human health remain poorly understood. This form of ionizing radiation causes significant changes to biological systems including damage to DNA structure by altering epigenetic phenotype with emphasis on DNA methylation. Building on previous work by Kennedy et al. (Sci Rep 8(1): 6709. 10.1038/S41598-018-24755-8), we evaluated spatial DNA methylation patterns triggered by high-LET (56Fe, 28Si) and low-LET (X-ray) radiation and the influence of chromosome positioning and epigenetic architecture in distinct radial layers of cell nucleus. Next, we validated our results using gene expression data of mice irradiated with simulated GCR and JAXA astronauts. We showed that primarily 56Fe induces a persistent DNA methylation increase whereas 28Si and X-ray induce a decrease DNA methylation which is not persistent with time. Moreover, we highlighted the role of nuclear chromatin architecture in cell response to external radiation. In summary, our study provides novel insights towards epigenetic and transcriptomic response as well as chromatin multidimensional structure influence on galactic cosmic radiation damage.",
    "introduction": "With a growing interest in space travel1, it is pivotal to better understand how galactic cosmic radiation (GCR) impacts human health and how its detrimental effect can be minimized2. Ionizing radiation damages DNA structure by inducing double-stranded breaks, single-stranded breaks, base damage and changing epigenetic phenotype with emphasis on DNA methylation patterns3,4. During long exposure, these alterations are likely to increase the risk of cancer and degenerative diseases occurrence5. Besides hydrogen and helium, GCR consists of heavier atomic nuclei with high linear energy transfer (high-LET) values which are of great danger for human health. Recently, Kennedy et al.6 investigated an effect of high-LET 56Fe, 28Si ions on DNA methylation patterns in comparison to low-LET X-ray appearing in terrestrial radiation. The researchers found that the methylation status of 56Fe irradiated CpG sites can distinguish normal tissue from lung adenocarcinomas and squamous cell lung carcinomas. Additionally, the researchers showed acute radiation-induced methylation changes which persisted over time with heritable imprint across epigenome. These findings where further investigated by Nwanaji-Enwerem et al.7 showing that 56Fe exposure was associated with accelerations in epiTOC2 epigenetic clock suggesting that DNA methylation may be a sensitive biomarker of high-LET 56Fe ion exposure. Chromatin packages the eukaryotic genome through DNA folding ranging from single nucleosome to entire chromosome8. Negatively charged DNA is wrapped around nucleosomes consisting of two copies of four positively charged histone proteins9. In addition to the core chromatin components, histone-modifying enzymes may alter chromatin compaction by changing its accessibility. The accessibility level is connected with chromatin modifications. In particular, H3 lysine 4 tri-methylation (H3K4me3) and histone H3 lysine 27 tri-methylation (H3K27me3) were used to profile ‘active’ and ‘repressed’ promoters respectively. Furthermore, histone H3 lysine 9 tri-methylation (H3K9me3) was used to profile heterochromatin loci and histone H3 lysine 27 acetylation (H3K27ac) to profile enhancers10. There were a few reports suggesting that high-LET4 and ultraviolet11 induced DNA damage may be affected by chromatin structure. However, until now there are no studies investigating a DNA methylation pattern induced by low-/high-LET and spatial chromosomal conformation capture to explore the effects of chromatin physical properties on irradiation outcome. Importantly, with the recent development of high-throughput capture chromatin confirmation methods (Hi-C)12 and advanced algorithms to simulate the three-dimensional structure of nuclei such as Chrom3D, it is now possible to address the irradiation effects associated with chromatin conformation13. Recently, to access the multi-dimensional chromatin interactions researches were using Hi-C data for compartmentalization dividing chromatin into compartments associated with gene expression regulation14,15. For the purpose of our work, we used Hi-C data to create detailed nuclear division introducing five distinct radial nuclear layers. Additionally, we characterized each layer separately using various of epigenetic and transcriptomic features. Specifically, we explored an effect of high-LET and low-LET ions on methylation DNA patterns in human lung epithelial cells using a previously published dataset of Kennedy et al.6. Further, we tried to understand how the radiation penetrates cell nucleus and influences methylation levels in distinct layers of nucleus, as well as how spatial chromosomal conformation and epigenetic architecture influence DNA alterations triggered by external radiation. To achieve this, we used existing publicly available in-vitro and in-vivo data and performed the following analyses: (1) Hi-C analysis to check how three-dimensional structure of cell nucleus impacts response to irradiation. Additionally, we divided cell nucleus into five laterally distributed layers to identify potential irradiation effects associated with peripheral and internal positioning of chromatin and other epigenetic features; (2) chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) data to assess the impact of distinct histone modifications on DNA methylation changes and (3) microarrays, and RNA-seq data to assess the impact of gene expression on irradiation response. This research addresses the pressing need to understand the impact of galactic cosmic radiation (GCR) on human health, driven by the increasing interest in space travel. Our study builds on existing knowledge, investigating the influence of DNA structure on radiation outcomes. We used the concept of radial nuclear layers to explore how chromatin properties, including histone modifications and spatial conformation, affect DNA methylation alterations induced by low- and high-LET ions. Leveraging recent technological advances, such as high-throughput capture chromatin confirmation, we created a nuanced nuclear division with five nonoverlapping nuclear layers to better understand the spatial distribution of chromatin and its features, as well as its impact on radiation response. Our multiomics approach integrates Hi-C, ChIP-seq, and microarray/RNA-seq data, providing insights into the complex interplay between chromatin architecture, epigenetic modifications, gene expression and the cellular response to GCR. This research aims to contribute valuable information for developing strategies to minimize the adverse effects of cosmic radiation during space travel.",

    "conclusion": "This is the first study exposing influence of chromatin physical properties on DNA methylation patterns triggered by high-LET and low-LET radiation. Our work shows that each of investigated radiation types induce distinct DNA methylation patterns. Additionally, we exposed the major role of spatial chromosomal positioning and distribution of histone modifications which have undeniable influence on the effect of cosmic radiation on human cells. Finally, we validated our in vitro observations regarding chronic effect of high-LET particles, with in vivo models and astronauts’ data. As such, we supported our primary analysis with gene expression data of radiation exposed mice tissues including liver, heart, mammary gland, blood and retina as well as blood tissue from six JAXA astronauts’. Our findings partially support those reported in the original publication by Kennedy et al.6. Similarly, we showed that each of primarily investigated radiation types induce a unique imprint on the epigenome. However, we observed that methylation changes which occur early, persist over time only when caused by 56Fe particle. Thus, after 28Si and X-rays’ exposure, we found a methylation peak at the beginning and a decrease towards baseline level over time. In line to previous observations a vast majority of identified methylation sites was located in and around CpG islands, and active genic regions (promoters, enhancers). The differences in results when compared to original publication could be of a various reason6. Specifically, we focused on rigorously chosen differentially methylated sites applying several thresholds of significance. To asses this, we established pairs to compare particles between each other. On the other side, in primary publication authors were focused on global DNA methylation status including all probes without DNA methylation change thresholds and later on assessing differences only by comparison of doses within the individual particle. To support our approach, we validated the perseverance of epigenome imprints associated with distinct radiation exposure. To do this, we looked at gene expression of various mice tissues irradiated with different radiation types as well as JAXA astronauts data from blood liquid biopsies21,30–34. Collectively, our analysis confirmed that each of investigated radiation type induces a unique chronic gene expression pattern. Importantly, we found corresponding changes between DNA methylation and gene expression levels in terms of GCR particles as well as astronauts’ exposure to space radiation. Thus, however to properly examine the persistence of these patterns, multiple timepoints with longer period of observation would be preferred. Additionally, all experiments should be performed in the same research model to minimize potential heterogeneity among even similar cell lines or more advanced models. Interestingly, in recent years other researchers investigated both DNA methylome and transcriptome changes in several tissues exposed to spaceflight. In retinas of mice flown to space for 37-days period, Chen et al. found a large number of differentially methylated (DM) genes and fewer differentially expressed genes at the transcriptome level. Majority of DM sites were hypomethylated and located in genes and promoters. The functional analysis of these data revealed that spaceflight had a major effect on extracellular matrix/cell junction and cell proliferation/apoptosis signaling42. On the other side, Acharya et al. demonstrated increased DNA methylation levels in the hippocampus and ultimately impaired cognitive condition of irradiated mice which could be mitigated by 5-iodotubercidin administration43. Finally, in NASA Twins Study, despite observing minor genome-wide DNA methylation changes, the gene enrichment analysis showed that during flight genes involved in the response to platelet-derived growth factor and T cell differentiation, and activation pathways in both CD4 and CF8 cells were enriched. Specifically, for CD4 cells genes involved in platelet aggregation, regulation of ossification, and cellular response to UV-B were enriched, whereas for CD8 cells genes involved in somatostatin signaling pathway and positive regulation of superoxide anion generation were enriched44. To further investigate the methylation data, our analyses focused on the impact of spatial chromosomal positioning on DNA methylation patterns or radiation properties and in vivo validation of induced epigenome imprints45. At first, based on spatial chromosome distribution, we tried to establish features associated with DMPs prevalence. At the beginning, we associated the higher frequency with outer positioning of chromosomal fragments in “L1” layer and its absence in “L5” layer. Hence, suggesting that when penetrating the nucleus, externally exposed DNA fragments are at the highest exposure to radiation beams which effect decreases with nucleus depth4. This observation however seemed promising, was not persistent for the whole genome, proposing the influence of other unknown factors. Recently, Garcia-Nieto et al.11, demonstrated that epigenome architecture in ultra violet (UV) irradiated non-malignant lung fibroblasts cells plays a role of a barrier to cancer development by regulation of carcinogen susceptibility. These findings highlighted the role of H3K9me3 modification in accumulating UV-induced DNA lesions in external heterochromatin regions, thus protecting inner localized euchromatin. As such, we looked at the spatial distribution of epigenetic histone modifications which may also play a role in the context of GCR11,46. Likewise, we observed the highest prevalence of DMPs in the periphery with the highest DNA methylation changes among active promoter and enhancers regions marked with H3K4me3 and H3K27ac histone modifications. However, when looking at all identified DMPs the highest methylation change was observed around the middle layer, right after the euchromatin-associated histone marks overcame the heterochromatin-associated H3K9me3 histone mark. Additionally, from that point, we started to observe a similar DMP chromosomal frequency pattern, suggesting the higher radiation vulnerability to occur differentially methylated sites as well as higher DNA methylation changes, especially among internally located promoters and enhancers sites. Specifically, this could be associated with higher chromatin accessibility. As previously mentioned, at first, we hypothesized that nucleus periphery absorbs the highest radiation dose. However, despite the highest frequency of DMPs observed, the highest DNA methylation change and corresponding chromosomal frequencies were observed around the middle layer of the nucleus. It could potentially suggest the occurrence of Bragg peak which depicts the energy loss of ionizing radiation during its travel through matter and after which the after which particles immediately come to rest47. It might be true especially for 28Si and X-rays, since we observed a higher DNA methylation change drop in inner layers for these two types of radiation. However, promising in principle X-rays penetrate the whole nucleus and lose energy in a random manner along the photon path, and not having Bragg peak present due to presence of uncharged photons in X rays. Additionally, DNA double strand breaks (DSBs), labeled as gH2AX foci, are distributed “randomly,” without accumulation at the nuclear periphery, but more prevalent in nuclear compartments with low chromatin density48,49. Although, never investigated for 56Fe and 28Si particles, based on similar experiments performed using 1 Gy for 11B and 1.2 Gy for 20Ne (LET 150 keV/µm and 171 keV/µm, respectively; Energy beam 8 MeV/n and 47 MeV/n, respectively), we could suspect that all of investigated particles by Kennedy et al., should penetrate the whole nucleus width, therefore, it is unlikely to observe a Bragg peak in the middle and all other nuclear layers50. Hence, our results could be potentially associated with chromatin accessibility or specific properties of different radiation types used, rather than particular histone modifications occurrence. Previous reports shown that the accumulation of double-strand breaks (DSBs) in peripheral heterochromatin does not accumulate more DSBs that euchromatin. Further, the exposure of cells to photonic radiation leads to a higher occurrence of DSBs in decondensed euchromatin. In contrast, exposure to high-LET results in more severe damage to dense heterochromatin. The distinct interaction of various types of radiation with different chromatin domains can be attributed to their diverse mechanisms of action. Photonic (gamma or X-ray) radiation primarily induces DNA damage indirectly through free radicals (ROS) generated by water radiolysis. Conversely, ions with high-LET directly damage DNA. Dense heterochromatin acts as a protective shield against ROS, yet it provides more DNA targets per volume for accelerated particles. Crucially, the extensive induction of DSBs by high-LET ions is not confined to peripheral heterochromatin but extends to the entire nucleus50–52. Hence, specific methylation changes may be generated as part of the systemic response of cells to irradiation. Indeed, post-irradiation epigenetic modifications have been shown not only to occur at sites of DSB damage, but also globally, throughout the cell nucleus53. Such a response can occur because chromatin represents a regulatory network and responses to various stresses as a system54,55. Hence, it seems more probable that these observations may be associated with chromatin accessibility and multidimensional architecture of these sequences rather than the epigenetic modification itself that makes H3K4me3 and H3K27ac-marked sequences more susceptible to radiation. Interestingly, Caron et al., found that most DMPs were located in chromosomes with low gene expression and located more peripherally compared to chromosomes with high gene expression. Thus, the intensity of DNA methylation changes correlates with both the low-expression (heterochromatic) state of chromatin and the peripheral location of chromatin. In our case, several of the few chromosomes with the highest abundance of DMPs are acrocentric chromosomes (12, 14, and 15), which also form a rim of heterochromatin around the whole width of the nucleus. It could indicate that heterochromatin architecture is a more important factor determining the intensity of DNA methylation changes after irradiation than nuclear location. Additionally, among heterochromatin layers, the highest DNA methylation changes were observed among TSS regions, which could mean that gene promoters within heterochromatin regions are highly affected by radiation56. In summary, it seems that epigenetic architecture plays a major role in cell response to irradiation. Specifically, it is architecture of heterochromatin associated domains with lower chromatin accessibility which could also explain the propagation of radiation laterally in nuclear layers, since DNA domains are more packed and in closer relationship to each other. Additionally, there were a few articles highlighting the role of histone marks in the context of GCR or microgravity. Gambacurta et al. discovered that H3K4me3, H3K27me2/3, H3K79me2/3 and H3K9me2/3 are engaged in cellular reprogramming that drives gene expression in blood-derived stem cells during osteoblastic differentiation induced by rapamycin under microgravity57. Furthermore, Singh et al. showed that in human T-lymphocyte cells, simulated-microgravity results in DNA hypomethylation58. However, gene expression analysis showed a decreased expression of histone deacetylases (HDAC) 1 which should have resulted in increased acetylation of histone H3 which in fact was decreased suggesting regulation of other HDAC. Finally, Koaykul et al. investigated neurogenic differentiation potential of passaged human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells under conventional and simulated microgravity59. Researchers discovered that conventional gravity conditions resulted in higher enrichment of H3K27me3 at neuronal promoters (NF-H and MAP2) when compared to simulated conditions. Contrary, there were no enrichment differences among H3K4me3. In summary, our study provides novel insights towards epigenetic nuclear architecture. We showed that GCR particles induce unique acute and chronic DNA methylation and gene expression patterns. Moreover, for the first time, we highlighted the role of spatial distribution of key epigenetic modification. Specifically, we point out the major role of heterochromatin associated domains in DNA accessibility and radiation response. Finally, we showed which regions of human genome are the most vulnerable to GCR and thus associated with higher DNA methylation changes. To overcome the main limitation of the study resulting from analyzing similar, but not the same cell types (bronchial epithelial cells and bronchial fibroblasts), we run additional analysis using in vivo models and human tissues. Importantly, all key in vitro findings were successfully validated across more advanced models. Further research should focus on extensive analysis using various methods discussed in this manuscript. All this should be performed in the same cell type or organism to minimize potential bias which could occur in our analysis. Additionally, it should further investigate the role of various histone modifications which could potentially limit the negative effects of GCR and other radiation types. If successfully treated, it could contribute to development of epigenetically modified preventing strategies against radiation-induced cell damage.",

    "abstract": "COVID-19, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, has caused significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. The betacoronavirus continues to evolve with global health implications as we race to learn more to curb its transmission, evolution, and sequelae. The focus of this review, the second of a three-part series, is on the biological effects of the SARS-CoV-2 virus on post-acute disease in the context of tissue and organ adaptations and damage. We highlight the current knowledge and describe how virological, animal, and clinical studies have shed light on the mechanisms driving the varied clinical diagnoses and observations of COVID-19 patients. Moreover, we describe how investigations into SARS-CoV-2 effects have informed the understanding of viral pathogenesis and provide innovative pathways for future research on the mechanisms of viral diseases.",
    "introduction": "As of January 13, 2023, over 671 million cases of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) worldwide have been reported, and more than 6.71 million lives have been claimed globally. The COVID-19 pandemic is caused by infection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus. The development and administration of vaccines and antiviral therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2 significantly reduced the local to global impact and burden of COVID-19. However, the global distribution of these resources has been unequal [1], ultimately prolonging viral transmission. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 quickly evolved into variants with increased transmission rates more capable of immune escape [2]. Therefore, we must increase our understanding of this novel virus, its variants, and the resulting short- and long-term effects of COVID-19 on human health. SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the genus Betacoronavirus, which includes viruses such as OC43, HKU1, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV [3]. SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped positive-sense RNA virus, whose genome is packaged in a helical ribonucleocapsid complex. The outer surface of the virus is studded with Spike (S) proteins that facilitate the infection of host cells by binding to its cognate cellular surface receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) through the S protein receptor binding domain (RBD) to allow for viral membrane fusion. Fusion leads to viral genome transfer into the host cell cytoplasm where viral replication can commence, leading to its various intracellular impacts. To read in more detail these processes, as well as structural elements of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, see our first review, ref. [3], focusing on intracellular SARS-CoV-2 viral effects [3]. In this second of a three-part comprehensive series of our series of SARS-CoV-2 reviews, we cover the extracellular and circulating signals and physiological effects of the viral disease, including the consequences and remodeling of organs, metabolism, humoral factors, and the immune system. In turn, the aim of this review series is to provide an overview of our current knowledge of SARS-CoV-2 and its biological effects from basic biology to clinical patient outcomes, highlighting also future areas of research given the ever-evolving nature of SARS-CoV-2,COVID-19, and its consequences for healthcare across the world.",
    "results": "",
    "conclusion": "SARS-CoV-2 and its resultant acute and chronic diseases, COVID-19 and PASC, have caused significant impacts worldwide. Here we describe and review the latest knowledge about the viral effect on our physiology, as well as the latest research on relevant whole-body metabolism pathways, circulating biological components (e.g., RNA, cytokine, hormones, etc.), and affected organ systems and their physiological adaptations consequent to SARS-CoV-2 infection. COVID-19 is a pleiotropic, complex, and dynamic condition (Fig. 4). The viral insults and cellular adaptations differ depending on the context, from cellular to organ systems, and intricate biochemistry ties and integrates these systems together. Herein, we have attempted to capture the prevalent host responses, as well as highlight gaps of knowledge that could be addressed with future research. We have also touched on relevant biochemical targets with potential for mitigating COVID-19 in the human host, and we will describe current and in-development treatment modalities that affect these in Part 3 of our review.",

    "title": "Aging and putative frailty biomarkers are altered by spaceflight",
    "link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11166946/",
    "abstract": "Human space exploration poses inherent risks to astronauts’ health, leading to molecular changes that can significantly impact their well-being. These alterations encompass genomic instability, mitochondrial dysfunction, increased inflammation, homeostatic dysregulation, and various epigenomic changes. Remarkably, these changes bear similarities to those observed during the aging process on Earth. However, our understanding of the connection between these molecular shifts and disease development in space remains limited. Frailty syndrome, a clinical syndrome associated with biological aging, has not been comprehensively investigated during spaceflight. To bridge this knowledge gap, we leveraged murine data obtained from NASA’s GeneLab, along with astronaut data gathered from the JAXA and Inspiration4 missions. Our objective was to assess the presence of biological markers and pathways related to frailty, aging, and sarcopenia within the spaceflight context. Through our analysis, we identified notable changes in gene expression patterns that may be indicative of the development of a frailty-like condition during space missions. These findings suggest that the parallels between spaceflight and the aging process may extend to encompass frailty as well. Consequently, further investigations exploring the utility of a frailty index in monitoring astronaut health appear to be warranted.",
    "introduction": "Missions beyond low Earth orbit are the new frontier of crewed space exploration. Future missions to Mars as well as long-duration missions to the Moon will be significantly more sustained than any previous deep space mission. During transit, the space environment presents key challenges for astronauts’ safety1. Previous literature describes microgravity, radiation exposure, isolation and confinement as major stressors that are able to induce pathophysiological changes in the heart, skeletal muscle, and immune system, as well as bone loss, central nervous system alterations, and increased cancer risk2–4. Thus, there is increasing interest to identify the molecular mechanisms driving those health risks, including changes in mitochondrial function, genetic and epigenetic regulation, telomere-length dynamics, DNA damage, and oxidative stress3,5 (Fig. 1). Interestingly, the molecular mechanisms of spaceflight-related stressors share similarities with the hallmarks of aging: mitochondrial dysfunction, genomic instability, epigenetic alterations, and telomere length changes (including brief elongation in flight and increased shorter telomeres post-flight), cellular senescence, and dysbiosis, among others6. As a defined set of aging-related molecular changes, the hallmarks of aging may be specifically studied to assess spaceflight impact on human physiology, which could induce a condition similar to premature or pathological aging3.",
    "results": "",
    "conclusion": "To our knowledge, no prior links to frailty-like signatures have been observed in the context of spaceflight, and these markers represent an important direction for future research, especially as mission durations increase to years. In recent years, human space research has benefitted from collecting and integrating diverse types of biological data, such as genomics, proteomics, and metabolomics, and storing them in biobanks for future analysis19,50. These multi-omics data and biobanks continue to provide valuable insights into the aging-like processes in astronauts during long-term space missions and help identify potential biomarkers and interventions to counteract them25,51–53. In our manuscript, we include data from NASA’s OSDR, the SpaceX Inspiration4 and the JAXA astronaut study. These initiatives are hallmarks in the development of data banking strategies such as the Space Omics and Medical Atlas (SOMA)54. The NASA Twins study along with the JAXA Cell-Free Epigenome and Inspiration4 data reported here and elsewhere (Figs. 6 and 7) highlight the emerging ability to conduct omic analyses on astronaut samples 27,39,55. We propose the use of omics data to investigate the development of aging-like phenomena in spaceflight, which can also help improve our understanding of aging metrics like clonal hematopoiesis56, and also link to a wide array of new data from the SOMA package of data and papers 48,53,55,55,57–65. Space medicine research has been mostly focused on the acute and medium-term effects of spaceflight on human physiology. However, some attributes related to the exposure to the space environment resemble aging-like pathophysiology: DNA damage, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction3. Because of these similarities, observations from the aging field can be useful to understand the biological changes driven by spaceflight. In contrast with aging on Earth, it is unclear whether those molecular modifications last after reentry, and for this reason we refer to them as aging-like phenomena. Nevertheless, despite acute events such as space motion sickness and autonomic imbalance resolving after astronaut’s return to ground, the effects of these aging-like alterations might be clinically manifest in a chronic exposure scenario, like a long-duration mission to Mars, and could potentially trigger chronic disease development. Studies in genetic/genomic aging models such as C. elegans and clinical evidence have demonstrated that the control of lifespan and health span are not identical49,53; therefore, there is an increasing need to identify markers able to determine the biological age of an individual. One proposed marker is the frailty index, which can serve as a better health indicator than chronological age, translating what is suggested by previous biological and clinical literature7. Here, we examined if aging and putative frailty biomarkers change during spaceflight. Our results from both rodent and human samples suggest that alterations indeed occurred in aging-related pathways to a different extent depending on the tissue. Importantly, we also found changes in expression of putative frailty genes, raising the possibility that these could be used as indicators of physiological changes during spaceflight much as they are being examined for utility in clinical assessment of physiological changes with age on Earth. Beyond health assessment, the ability to conduct -omic studies on astronauts allows for combining astronaut and model organism datasets in order to conduct truly translational research in space. Such studies would expand our understanding of molecular control of (patho)physiological changes in response to spaceflight. The expression of putative frailty related biomarkers in JAXA Cell-Free Epigenome samples is altered during spaceflight, compared to ground control, as shown in Fig. 6; interestingly, several gene expression levels do not return to baseline after reentry. Although their expression could revert to normal after a longer period, this altered expression could hint to the presence of spaceflight-induced modifications that persist for longer than expected. For example, AKT1 is upregulated at all timepoints after reentry. A persisted upregulation of the gene is linked to age related cardiac disease and dementia in animal models45,46. The presence of biomarker gene expression that does not revert to normal challenges the concept that every physiological change induced by spaceflight is reverted after astronauts’ return to Earth. This notion is not novel, for example, a recent report showed the development of distinct mutational profiles in astronauts66; on these bases, it would be worth monitoring these biomarkers for longer timepoints after reentry, and to exclude the possibility that they underlie any sub-clinical disease development. Permanent modifications after exposure to important stressors happen in patients as well. For instance, admission to Intensive Care Unit and severe COVID-19 have been associated with epigenetic changes that might alter aging-related gene expression45,46. In addition to long-term spaceflight exposure, short-duration spaceflight data such as those provided by the i4 mission are also relevant to detect early signs of frailty development. In fact, frailty is not only associated to long term chronic disease pathways: clinical research hints that short term exposure to stressors such as COVID-19 hyperinflammatory response are capable of developing frailty-associated traits56. Regardless, longer spaceflight duration might be required to detect wider alterations in putative frailty biomarkers and clinically manifested phenotypes in astronauts; this highlights the need for further studies and validation. Differential expression of frailty genes in astronauts’ cell-free DNA and PBMCs (Figs. 6 and 7) is not inherently the same as what is observed in the Open Science Dataset’s (OSDs) human samples (Fig. 5). Despite frailty signals potentially being detected in astronaut’s blood, it is not feasible to directly pair this result with the differential expression of frailty-related genes in muscle biopsies, due to the absence of matched data. As previously suggested, this represents an opportunity to apply cutting-edge clinical research tools for monitoring and researching astronaut health. Indeed, genome sequencing onboard the ISS is currently used in the microbiological monitoring program67, paving the way for use in astronaut studies on the ISS. Previous studies of astronaut health have largely been conducted using standard clinical markers such as blood panels. While there is an emerging blood panel for assessment of frailty68, these would need to be processed on Earth. By contrast, the assessment of a future clinically validated transcriptomic panel for frailty could be conducted on ISS or other spacecrafts. Regardless of which panel or where such a panel is assessed, our findings suggest that future studies aimed at establishing such a validated model for astronauts could be fruitful areas of investigation for monitoring and improving astronaut health in- and post-flight. The establishment and validation of such a panel could either be done by correlating with physiological measures already captured by NASA’s standard measures program or correlating with physiological measures adapted from the emerging frailty indexes. One of the most pronounced findings in both rodent and human datasets is the induction of interferon alpha and gamma responsive pathways. Interferons are cytokines associated with modulation of the immune response which is a known consequence of spaceflight69. Our observation of the activation of interferon pathways (Fig. 3) suggests that the activation of the innate immune system is a conserved mammalian response to spaceflight and aging. In the aging field, the concept of inflammaging suggests that the chronic low-grade dysregulation of the immune system that happens with aging underpins the development of diseases such as atherosclerosis, type II diabetes, and sarcopenia7. Indeed, at least ten clinical biomarkers of inflammation correlate well with the frailty index70. Making the inflammaging parallel to spaceflight, it could be that an increased low-grade inflammatory response during spaceflight drives and/or worsens frailty and/or related processes (for example muscle wasting)67,71. Low grade inflammation contributes to the development of endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerosis on Earth7,72. In addition, radiation exposure can also lead to the development of cardiovascular disease in case of occupational exposure, as well as in cancer patients undergoing radiation therapy69,71,73. In astronauts, atherosclerosis could be promoted by an increased inflammatory status promoted by different stressors of the space environment (Fig. 1), and radiation exposure would play a primary role for it. Moon and Mars missions have a different radiation environment compared with the ISS, as astronauts traveling beyond Low Earth Orbit are potentially exposed to higher doses of galactic cosmic rays and solar particle event radiation69. Elevated radiation exposure promotes multiple dysregulations, causing cellular senescence in the endothelium, mitochondrial dysfunction and inflammation, driving endothelial dysfunction71. Exposure to higher doses of space radiation beyond low Earth orbit could also have a different, and perhaps increased, impact on frailty-related hallmarks and genes. Concerning endothelial dysfunction, an interplay between nitric oxide metabolism, production of reactive oxygen species and radiation exposure could play a role in the development of radiation-induced cardiovascular disease, as well as other disease pathways, in space74,75. Moreover, a pro-inflammatory and oxidative environment might facilitate the development of the spaceflight associated neuro-ocular syndrome (SANS)76; this condition would also increase the disability status of the crew. Across species, altered metabolism is one of the most consistently reported responses to spaceflight. Unsurprisingly, these changes vary from organism to organism among microbes and tissue to tissue in animals (Fig. 8). A recent rodent transcriptomic study confirmed that the typical mammalian coordination of metabolism between the liver and muscles on Earth continues to function similarly in flight77. This metabolic axis is a key determinator of health with age, whose disruption is associated with obesity, diabetes, and frailty. Emerging techniques such as metabolomics are beginning to address the role and mechanisms of metabolic alteration in human muscle with age73. Here we have employed another emerging analytical approach, metabolic flux modeling from transcriptomic data (Fig. 8). Our results confirm that metabolic flux analysis successfully demonstrated metabolic alterations as expected, dependent on tissue type. Importantly, while our results confirm past observations that mitochondrial and metabolic changes are conserved features of space flown tissues and organisms3, they also demonstrate that the functional changes via metabolic flux are more important than the simple global up versus down changes often employed with reductionist approaches. The effect of microgravity exposure may cause specific mitochondrial protein adaptations that affect skeletal muscle tissue, namely 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase activity, palmitate oxidation and cytochrome c oxidase enzymatic activity75,78,79. It is noteworthy that tissues might respond differently to microgravity and the mitochondrial bioenergetics adaptations seen in skeletal muscle may be different from the ones seen in cardiac muscle; however new sequencing data may provide an insight into these differences18,75. Thus, using data from multiple tissues and time points begins to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms underlying the development of frailty in response to spaceflight. Importantly, our results demonstrate that these approaches can be employed directly in astronauts and/or in combination with model systems. Muscle decline is another conserved feature between spaceflight and aging. It is also thought to contribute to frailty. Recently, functional measures of muscle decline with age have been well correlated with evolutionarily conserved gene expression changes with age27,74. In humans, changes in metabolic gene expression appear to occur prior to changes in inflammatory gene expression, suggesting that aging human muscle undergoes metabolic remodeling prior to becoming inflamed and sarcopenic—also highlighting the importance of temporal/dynamic data71. Similarly, in humans subjected to bedrest, an analogue for spaceflight, changes in metabolic gene expression and metabolic activity are an early event tied to altered intramuscular calcium levels80. The recent study of muscle-liver metabolic cross talk in mice used the same mouse muscle datasets we used for this manuscript (Fig. 8) and found altered glucose and lipid metabolism in response to spaceflight, consistent with past literature on space flown mammalian muscle77. Combining this past analysis with our new analysis of sarcopenic gene expression changes, it is noteworthy that few sarcopenic gene expression changes are noted in the space flown muscles with more observed changes in the soleus, which was the muscle displaying the largest decline in mass25. Together, these results raise the possibility that metabolic changes may indeed precede the loss of muscle mass in spaceflight, as observed with age and bedrest on Earth. It remains an open question if, like sarcopenia, metabolic alterations occur earlier than the inflammatory alterations in flight and whether inflammation or an altered metabolism is the key driver for a frailty-like phenotype in space. Lastly, given the similarities between transcriptomic changes with age and spaceflight, the facts that estrogen receptor has recently been proposed to be a key regulator of muscle gene expression changes with age and that estrogen receptor pathways have recently been shown to display differences in flight, raise the possibility that estrogen receptor pathways are key modulators of muscle health in space27,77,81. The restriction of available sources poses a frequent challenge in the field of space medical and biological research. In order to adequately tackle our research inquiry with comprehensive information, we adopted a diverse range of data from various public sources. It is essential to note that each individual experimental model incorporated does not entirely encapsulate the complete biology of astronauts exposed to space conditions. Therefore, caution is advised when extending conclusions from one model system to another or from cellular and tissue-level observations to the overall phenotypes of organisms. Nonetheless, a noteworthy aspect of our findings is the utilization of a weight-of-evidence approach, wherein data across multiple models are analyzed. This method reveals conserved pathways that consistently emerge in independent datasets, likely indicating fundamental biological responses akin to frailty in the context of spaceflight. Pursuing the development of biobanks for multi-omics data will deeply benefit space medicine and biology research. Yet, concurrently, bridging the gap between molecular changes, pathophysiological processes and phenotype development requires multi-omics biological data to be associated with individual physical metrics. This is crucial to investigate complex syndromes such as frailty. Future studies will be conducted to observe global and systemic impact on how the frailty index will change during spaceflight.",

    "abstract": "Our previous research revealed a key microRNA signature that is associated with spaceflight that can be used as a biomarker and to develop countermeasure treatments to mitigate the damage caused by space radiation. Here, we expand on this work to determine the biological factors rescued by the countermeasure treatment. We performed RNA-sequencing and transcriptomic analysis on 3D microvessel cell cultures exposed to simulated deep space radiation (0.5 Gy of Galactic Cosmic Radiation) with and without the antagonists to three microRNAs: miR-16-5p, miR-125b-5p, and let-7a-5p (i.e., antagomirs). Significant reduction of inflammation and DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) activity and rescue of mitochondria functions are observed after antagomir treatment. Using data from astronaut participants in the NASA Twin Study, Inspiration4, and JAXA missions, we reveal the genes and pathways implicated in the action of these antagomirs are altered in humans. Our findings indicate a countermeasure strategy that can potentially be utilized by astronauts in spaceflight missions to mitigate space radiation damage.",
    "introduction": "The perils of human space exploration span the gamut of exposure to space radiation, altered gravity fields, and prolonged isolation in a hostile/closed environment1. The profound effects on human health may include bone and muscle atrophy, increased intracranial pressure, enhanced risk of developing cancer and cardiovascular disease, and impaired neurocognitive functions2. These physical and psychological stressors present a major concern for maintaining the overall health of spaceflight crews. The biological consequences of spaceflight also present a unique opportunity to analyze aspects of natural and disease pathologies that occur terrestrially3–5. Circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) critically impact cell non-autonomous regulation of post-transcriptional processes, can be used as biomarkers6,7, and are associated with human diseases8–10. We have extensively characterized a circulating miRNA signature associated with the space environment using biomedical samples from astronauts, in vivo rodent models, in vitro cellular models, and 3D human-derived cell cultures under simulated and real space exposure11–14. Transcriptome analyses demonstrated expression of candidate miRNAs were altered in liver, kidney, adrenal gland, thymus, mammary gland, skin, and skeletal muscle from space-flown animal models11 and revealed a conserved miRNA signature between rodents and humans13. The altered miRNA signature discovered after exposure to space irradiation was predicted to affect the cardiovascular system and was widely associated with mitochondrial dysfunction13. Treatment of 3D microvessel cell cultures with miRNA inhibitors (referred to as antagomirs) targeting three of these miRNAs, miR-16-5p, miR-125b-5p, and let-7a-5p, prevented microvessel collapse13 and rescued the inhibition of angiogenesis15 caused by space radiation exposure. Multi-omic analyses of biomedical profiles of astronauts along with several hundred space-related data points showed that major shifts in mitochondrial gene expression may be central to spaceflight-associated health risks12. Mitochondria are responsible for metabolic activity through oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), and mitochondrial dysfunction decreases energy availability, alters cellular metabolism, and leads to cancer, diabetes, heart disease, and muscular and neurological disorders16. Here, a 3D model for human microvessels is used to explore the cellular biology consequences of miRNA inhibition, particularly focusing on how the endothelial cell layer may be involved with cardiovascular damage. We find that antagomir treatment reduces DNA damage induced by space radiation, and is associated with improved stress responses at the molecular and morphological levels. Furthermore, we confirm the specific targets of the miRNAs in astronaut samples from the NASA Twin Study17, a JAXA mission18, and the first civilian commercial spaceflight mission, Inspiration4 (I4)19. Our results suggest that these miRNAs may be targeted as countermeasures to alter cellular signaling pathways to mitigate spaceflight damage and reduce human health risks in human spaceflight missions.",

    "conclusion": "Our previous study13–15 demonstrated a significant association between circulating miRNAs and spaceflight-associated health risks. These 13 circulating miRNAs were connected to the immune system, cellular differentiation, motility, proliferation, and survival13,15. Three miRNAs, miR-16-5p, miR-125b-5p, and let-7a-5p, were linked to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease during spaceflight13,15,56. A collapse of microvessels in 3D cell cultures after exposure to space radiation13,21 was associated with breakdown of the endothelial barrier and the loss of tight junctions57. GCR-induced inhibition of microvessels during angiogenesis was dependent on the linear energy transfer (LET) of the charged particles58,59. Although the microvessel cells are post-mitotic, differential effects on DNA repair occur according to radiation quality (e.g. LET)20. The mixed simplified simulation of GCR uses five ions of different energies (Hydrogen, Helium, Oxygen, Silicon, and Iron)48 which are highly effective at inhibiting angiogenesis14. Several studies have shown the cellular consequences of miRNA activity, including the three miRNAs researched in the present study. Let-7a is involved in many cellular processes, immunity, and protective functions60. The majority of cellular processes involving let-7a are well studied in development, proliferation, differentiation, and cancer, but its role in inflammation, cardiovascular diseases, and/or stroke are not well understood61. Let-7a is involved in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell homeostasis such as self-renewal, proliferation, quiescence, and differentiation by blocking the TGFβ pathway and amplifying Wnt signaling62. MicroRNA 16 (miR-16) is linked to human malignancies63 and can modulate the cell cycle, inhibit cell proliferation, promote cellular apoptosis, and suppress tumorigenicity64. The targets of miR-16 may be directly responsible for these effects such as the anti-apoptotic gene BCL-2 (B-cell lymphoma 2)65, numerous genes involved in the G1-S transition, such as cyclin D1, cyclin D3, cyclin E1 and CDK6 (cyclin-dependent kinase 6), and genes involved in the Wnt signaling pathway, such as WNT3A (wingless-type MMTV integration site family, member 3A)66. In endothelial cells, angiogenic factors, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), VEGF receptor-2 (VEGFR2), and fibroblast growth factor receptor-1 (FGFR1), were identified by bioinformatic approaches and subsequently validated as targets by miR-1667. The miR-125 family plays an important role in the growth and development of animals, as well as stress response, p53 activation68 and the occurrence and development of cancer69. In addition, the role of miR-125 in cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases cannot be ignored. The miR-125 family is associated with the development and differentiation of mammalian embryonic hearts70. Furthermore, it plays an important role in diseases and pathophysiological processes such as, coronary heart disease, myocardial infarction, ischemia-reperfusion injury, stroke, myocardial fibrosis, endothelial cell injury and myocardial cell apoptosis70. A recent paper has described the presence of miR-125b in osteoblast-derived matrix vesicles (MVs)71 and in bone matrix where it hampers osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption by targeting PRDM1 (PR domain zinc finger protein 1), thus suggesting that miR-125b might have an active role in the development of vascular calcifications72. All three miRNAs were initially found to be associated with cancer and neoplasia. However, unregulated cell cycle control is unlikely to be the only pathway that mitigates the biological effects of GCR. Our results from the mature microvessel model support this notion, since mature microvessels are postmitotic and the timing of events is too rapid to be downstream of cell cycle control, although this does not rule out an indirect involvement of cell cycle proteins. At 24 h after GCR irradiation and 48 h after antagomir treatment, protection of microvessel morphology is observed compared to the GCR-stressed control not treated with antagomirs. Individual inhibition of each target miRNA and the resulting mitigation of GCR effects suggests that each miRNA is similarly effective and therefore the targets of each must contain genes that are active in this process. Twelve of 21 key genes targeted by at least two of the three miRNAs (Fig. 5a) are potential candidates for protecting the microvessel physiology. These include genes involved in apoptosis and p53-mediated cell death, cell cycle and mitotic phase transitions, innate immune response, and mitochondrial processes related with amino acids, and cholesterol metabolism (Supplementary Fig. 5). However, apoptosis is not measurable in these cultures as much higher doses of heavy and light ions are needed to detect this mechanism21 by TUNEL assay although this does not rule out earlier apoptosis signaling. Direct action of genes involved in the cell cycle and mitotic phase transitions is unlikely in mature microvessels. Involvement of cellular programs from the innate immune response is a possibility, since immune-associated genes seem to be heavily regulated by space radiation and miRNAs. The effects of the antagomir cocktail on suppressing DNA repair indicates a much earlier time of action, likely upstream of the rescue of angiogenesis or the protection of mature vessels. This suggests that early response genes involved in radiation exposure might be targets for the antagomirs; these would include genes of general inflammatory and immune pathways. There are 5 genes that are affected in common with all 3 antagomirs. When inhibited, all products of these genes are candidates for mediating the resistance to radiation damage, although the effects of other genes affected by each individual antagomir cannot be ruled out. Each gene has functions that could contribute to GCR resistance. APAF1 and NIBAN1 are involved in the control of apoptosis and may prevent progression towards senescence73. XPO6 and SLC7A1 are involved in transport across membranes between cell compartments, a process involved in early responses to cell stressors74,75. PDPR regulates pyruvate phosphorylation and may facilitate protective functions that require a higher energy output76. Overall it appears that several pathways are involved in protection and are acting in concert to push the cells into a more healthy and active biological state. Changes in immune response appear to be a hallmark of space radiation and targeted by miRNAs. We previously have shown that cytotoxic and helper T cells are suppressed and key innate immune response-related factors are dysregulated in C57BL/6 female mice exposed to 0.5 Gy GCR irradiation14. Markers of CD4 (helper) and CD8 (cytotoxic) T cell populations in the I4 astronauts (Fig. 6j, k) also indicate dysregulation occurring during spaceflight. The similarities between both in vivo and in vitro experiments demonstrate a parallelism that gives confidence about using the 3D cell culture model to confirm the effectiveness of the antagomir treatment strategy to prevent and countermeasure space radiation damage. Spaceflight can affect mitochondrial stability12. The ability of antagomirs to rescue mitochondria-associated pathways affected by radiation indicates the potential for using these antagomirs to rescue harmful phenotypes in space travelers. In particular, the OXPHOS pathway, which was downregulated upon treatment with GCR-stress, showed a rescue-like effect (Fig. 10). Impaired OXPHOS can lead to cell death due to insufficient ATP for energy use, changes in mitochondrial membrane potential or overproduction of prooxidant agents77. Electron carriers, like the amidoxime-reducing complex, assists in this process and show downregulation in the presence of radiation. This radiation phenotype has the potential to progress to inflammation. Specifically, the genes whose upregulation was returned to normal by the addition of antagomir include those of complex I, complex V, and other OXPHOS subunits. Genotoxic stress caused by ionizing or UV radiations is a potent inducer of cellular senescence. Curiously, GCR suppresses most of the pathways associated with cellular senescence curated based on data from fibroblasts, renal epithelial cells and adipocytes induced to senescence by different stimuli, including X-ray irradiation, oncogene overexpression, antiretroviral drug or hyperinsulinemia50,51. This suggests that either GCR does suppress classical cellular senescence or GCR-induced senescence in our 3D cell culture differs from the previously studied mechanisms of senescence induction by radiation (Supplementary Fig. 8). The latter is supported by previous evidence demonstrating that different senescence stimuli drive very distinct phenotypes51. The only senescence-related pathway induced by GCR in our model is oncogene-induced senescence, which is consistent with activation of p53 target genes. The antagomirs have no effect on the mature culture model, but in the irradiated angiogenesis model they promote various senescence-related pathways. Future studies are required to assess the role of these miRNAs in senescence induction by more classical stimuli. Future studies are also required, as stated above, to decipher GCR effect on multicellular microvascular models, in which differential irradiation effect on the different cell population (fibroblast/pericyte and endothelial cells for example) might impaired, or not, paracrine communication and then the global effect in vivo (human). The interplay between orphan genes and miRNAs has not been previously studied. We observe a significant change in orphan gene expression from GCR irradiation stress and from antagomir treatment (Fig. 4d and Supplementary Fig. 4). Many orphan genes were upregulated in the 3D mature microvessel cell culture and interestingly, downregulated in the angiogenesis model. Some of these orphan genes may be integrated into the metabolic and regulatory processes that are targeted by the miRNAs. Orphan genes themselves are simple proteins that often act by binding to conserved proteins such as transcription factors or receptors31,78. Some orphan genes are key for reproduction, some are toxins, and many confer resistance to stress30,31,79–82, however, orphan genes do not appear to encode enzymes, likely because of the very long time scale required for evolution of a specialized catalytic site82. Many orphan genes are expressed to high levels only in discrete tissues or under specific abiotic stresses or diseases30,32,79,82,83. The alteration of orphan gene expression with GCR irradiation and antagomir treatment warrants further examination. Due to the nature of performing experiments in the space environment, it can be limiting and difficult to simulate perfectly the conditions in space in ground experiments. So to perfectly recreate the space radiation dose and dose-rate that astronauts will receive during long-duration spaceflights (lasting several months) is not possible. The ground-based experimental setup reported in this manuscript used for irradiating with GCRs currently represents the best approximation for validation of predictive models and while enabling countermeasure developments. Thus, extrapolation and comparison from the astronaut data to cell culture studies conducted on Earth as well as mice experiments both on Earth and during spaceflight are key to meaningful interpretation of biological results applicable to space flight. Lastly, it is possible that the differences in the radiation delivery might account for any deviations between the results we are observing. The present microvascularized model is a simplified system hosting endothelial cells only and one shall point out the absence of the very important pericytes. Indeed, it is well known that when endothelial cells organize into microvascular networks (during angiogenesis), stromal cells associate with newly formed microvessels to stabilize the structure. Fibroblasts can play this role by adopting a pericytic-type phenotype84–86. To push forward the full understanding of the GCR effect on angiogenesis, it might be necessary, in a close future, to complexify the model, at least toward a multicellular compartment87. In addition, it will be essential for future studies to test the toxicity of the antagomirs in in vivo models, since the tissue model utilized for this manuscript is limited for this purpose. The inhibition of three miRNAs, miR-16-5p, miR-125b-5p, and let-7a-5p, facilitates the reduction of cellular damage from ionizing radiation exposure. Treatment with antagomirs that inhibited these three miRNAs before and after radiation exposure in mature and angiogenesis 3D human HUVEC cell culture models, completely prevented the microvessel collapse and inhibition of microvessel development caused by GCR exposure. The potential effectiveness of these antagomirs to reduce prolonged tissue damage through modified DNA repair activity and alterations in cellular mitochondria offers a unique target for the development of radiation countermeasures for spaceflight as well as for terrestrial applications.",

    "abstract": "Mounting ambitions and capabilities for public and private, non-government sector crewed space exploration bring with them an increasingly diverse set of space travelers, raising new and nontrivial ethical, legal, and medical policy and practice concerns which are still relatively underexplored. In this piece, we lay out several pressing issues related to ethical considerations for selecting space travelers and conducting human subject research on them, especially in the context of non-governmental and commercial/private space operations.",
    "introduction": "It has been over 50 years since the first human walked on the Moon. Since then, most commercialized spaceflights have been contracts granted to private companies by various governments to launch satellites, e.g., communication and GPS devices, into Earth’s orbit. In recent years, the definition of commercial spaceflight has expanded to include human transportation between Earth and habitats in Low Earth Orbit and future lunar or other extraterrestrial outposts. Once considered nearly impossible, commercial space travel is now a reality, due to rapid technological advancement in the private sector, large-scale investment from governments, and continued public interest. With the first crewed launch of SpaceX Dragon to the International Space Station (ISS), on May 30, 20201, a new era of public-private spaceflight partnership has emerged. Private companies such as Boeing, Virgin Galactic, Axiom, Sierra Space, and Blue Origin now create a steep commercial demand for crewed spaceflight, both for technological and recreational purposes. NASA has further partnered with Axiom Space for commercial utilization of the ISS until the world’s first commercial space station is built by 20282. There is currently a wide range of private/commercial spaceflights, ranging from suborbital flights lasting mere minutes to Axiom’s 1-2 week ISS missions to the first all-civilian orbital commercial spaceflight mission referred to as ‘Inspiration4’ (I4), comparable in duration (and health risks) to orbital shuttle missions1–3. Historically, government-sponsored spaceflights were mission-based and geared towards national interests, e.g., technological leadership, improving national security, creating high-quality jobs, or advancements in research. After the Cold War era and the “Space Race,” government investment in space exploration declined. In contrast, the idea of commercial spaceflight continues to gain significant popularity and the economic opportunities linked to this are enormous. This has been accompanied by an influx of investment and the development of new technology, such as initial viable Reusable Launch Vehicle models by SpaceX4. Despite this rapid technology development, governmental regulation of commercial spaceflight lags behind. There are some requirements commercial spaceflight providers have to meet, including requirements concerning environmental safety, payload, payload re-entry, financial stability, and coverage for maximum probable loss5. Yet, there has been only limited regulation concerning the selection and training of non-government-sponsored astronauts and no formal oversight governing medical research on such crews, whether orbital or suborbital. The United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs has collated national space laws relating to space activities from 42 countries6. While the regulations listed there cover a wide range of fields, such as objects in space, radiocommunication, and space activities, there is a general lack of health-associated regulations. This is a symptom of a bigger problem where there is little oversight of private sector spaceflight participants which, with Inspiration4, dearMoon7, and the upcoming Polaris program8, are already a reality. An increase in commercial/private and civilian space missions with a more diverse crew may provide an opportunity to collect data on health issues in space. While these data could shape medical standards and improve treatment choices for prolonged spaceflight, their collection and management should require strict regulation. At the same time, as spacefarers shift from professionally trained astronauts to private individuals without rigorous preparation or with existing medical conditions, there is a need to refine selection criteria and training for non-governmental space travelers. Yet, despite their importance and urgency, these considerations have gone relatively unexplored9. In this paper, we will lay out several pressing issues related to ethical considerations for selecting space travelers and research practices, especially in the context of non-governmental and private space operations. Although there are many other ethical issues related to space exploration – both commercial and otherwise10–19– our focus here is on ethical considerations regarding selection and human subject research. Note that while some of the issues we raise might be covered by guidelines, regulations, or law, this does not diminish the ethical considerations we discuss. A good example illustrating this point is NASA’s recent decision to unify the effective radiation exposure for male and female astronauts so as to not exceed 600 mSv, which translates to having to remain below 3% mean risk of cancer mortality above the non-exposed baseline mean, despite differences in male and female radiation-based cancer risk20,21. This decision is highly controversial, precisely because it is viewed by many as ethically problematic. Likewise, signing a consent form to undertake a certain activity (whether employer-mandated or not) does not make the proposed activity or consent process ethically unquestionable21. Indeed, our point here is that ethical considerations resulting from the increase in private and commercial spaceflight arise despite established rules and guidelines22,23. A note on terminology: SpaceX, Axiom, and others refer to their travelers as ‘crew’. This has important consequences since the limited Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) guidelines24 that are applicable to non-professional astronauts are somewhat more stringent for crew than ‘ordinary’ spaceflight occupants. To bypass ambiguity, we prefer the term ‘spaceflight occupants’ (SOs), using it to refer to non-professional space travelers lacking substantial spaceflight training. Further, we use the terms ‘laws’ and ‘regulations’ to refer to binding law and the neutral terms ‘guidelines’, ‘recommendations’, and ‘policy’ to refer to non-binding guiding instruments.",
    "results": "",
    "conclusion": "We are entering an exciting new era of space exploration previously only thought of as science fiction. Commercial/private and civilian spaceflights, such as Inspiration4 and the Polaris missions are no longer just a possibility but a reality. Exciting as these opportunities are, they also come with the burden of ensuring that future space travel will be as safe and ethical as possible. While governmental oversight has historically governed space activities, the emergence of non-governmental initiatives calls for unified ethical guidelines, safeguarding human well-being during selection, research, and decision-making in space. Since non-governmental outfits are not bound by the same rules in the same way, we as a community must ensure that the guidelines we set will guide space exploration according to the highest ethical and medical standards for humans that are currently possible, including selection of SOs, medical research ranging from human subject research to discussion of in-flight triage decisions. The added difficulties of non-universal terminology referring to different kinds of space travelers and of making guidelines sensitive to the diversity and variety of potential spaceflight endeavors will add further layers of complexity. The earlier and better any such guidelines can be implemented, the better the chances that space travel can be performed according to the safest and most optimal standards.",

    "title": "Innate immune responses of Drosophila melanogaster are altered by spaceflight.",
    "link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7000411/",
    "abstract": "While it has been shown that astronauts suffer immune disorders after spaceflight, the underlying causes are still poorly understood and there are many variables to consider when investigating the immune system in a complex environment. Additionally, there is growing evidence that suggests that not only is the immune system being altered, but the pathogens that infect the host are significantly influenced by spaceflight and ground-based spaceflight conditions. In this study, we demonstrate that Serratia marcescens (strain Db11) was significantly more lethal to Drosophila melanogaster after growth on the International Space Station than ground-based controls, but the increased virulence phenotype of S. marcescens did not persist after the bacterial cultures were passaged on the ground. Increased virulence was also observed in bacteria that were grown in simulated microgravity conditions on the ground using the rotating wall vessel. Increased virulence of the space-flown bacteria was similar in magnitude between wild-type flies and those that were mutants for the well-characterized immune pathways Imd and Toll, suggesting that changes to the host immune system after infection are likely not a major factor contributing towards increased susceptibility of ground-reared flies infected with space-flown bacteria. Characterization of the bacteria shows that at later timepoints spaceflight bacteria grew at a greater rate than ground controls in vitro, and in the host. These results suggest complex physiological changes occurring in pathogenic bacteria in space environments, and there may be novel mechanisms mediating these physiological effects that need to be characterized.",
    "introduction": "As space exploration extends beyond low Earth orbit, there is considerable interest in understanding the changes in human physiology under spaceflight conditions. Spaceflight includes not only long-term exposure to microgravity, but also radiation, isolation, and short-term exposure to hypergravity. Previous studies have demonstrated that these stressors have a significant impact on the ability of the immune system to respond appropriately to disease, including altered cytokine production,1–5 changes in immune cell proliferation and distribution4,6,7 and general alteration of immune homeostasis in both innate and adaptive immune systems.8,9 This apparent immune dysregulation is even more important when considering that there have been studies demonstrating significant effects of microgravity and spaceflight conditions on the pathogens that co-occur with humans in space habitats.10–17 Opportunistic pathogenic bacteria, such as those that can cause persistent infections in immunocompromised individuals, have been shown to have increased growth in spaceflight,18,19 increased antibiotic resistance, and increased virulence.20,21 Investigations of the effects of spaceflight in humans have been especially varied, likely due to both low sample sizes and variability in experimental methodology.22 The fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster) is a promising model for understanding the effects of spaceflight on human immunity and pathogenesis, as they have been shown previously to experience a dramatic shift in immune gene expression following spaceflight.23,24 Using invertebrate models for investigating the human immune system has proven both fruitful and convenient, as they are cost-effective, have short generation times, and importantly, have immune systems with high homology to humans.25,26 While invertebrates lack a characterized adaptive immune system, the inducible innate immune response of Drosophila melanogaster is highly similar to humans,25,27,28 with about 75% of human disease-causing genes with a functional homolog in the fruit fly.25,29 The human opportunistic bacteria Serratia marcescens has only recently emerged as a model for studying rapid shifts in virulence and antibiotic resistance due to increased nosocomial reports.30,31 Furthermore, S. marcescens has been found aboard the spacecraft Mir, and in condensed water aboard the International Space Station (ISS),32,33 suggesting that this ubiquitous pathogen should be monitored closely for spaceflight-induced changes that may pose a threat to immunocompromised astronauts who could be more susceptible to opportunistic pathogens. D. melanogaster has been recently used as a model for studying S. marcescens, as there are bacterial strains that have been isolated from wild-caught flies that are pathogenic.34–38 Importantly, the specific strains used in this study are not pathogenic to humans,34 making this system an ideal model for safely studying spaceflight-induced changes to S. marcescens using a model system. Studies in true spaceflight conditions are difficult to perform due to cost, limited availability of launches and crew time, and the complexity of experimental design under the tight volumetric and mass constraints of space habitats. Consequently, many studies on the effects of spaceflight on bacteria are also followed up with ground-based simulated microgravity experiments,16,17,39 which allows for further investigation into microgravity-related effects. In this study, the opportunistic pathogen Serratia marcescens was sent to the ISS, where it was exposed to true spaceflight conditions, while ground-based strains were used in tandem both as controls and as replicates grown in simulated microgravity conditions (rotating wall vessel (RWV) apparatus) in order to investigate whether changes in bacterial physiology could be replicated accurately in future ground-based studies. In our study, space-flown or simulated microgravity-treated bacteria were used to infect D. melanogaster to investigate changes in space-induced lethality, both in wild-type flies, as well as in immune pathway mutants. Results showed that both space-flown and ground-based microgravity simulations (e.g., low-shear modeled microgravity or LSMMG treatment) resulted in increased virulence of Serratia marcescens on D. melanogaster hosts. Interestingly, the increased virulence phenotype is lost after passaging of the space-flown and LSMMG-treated bacteria under ground conditions. Taken together, this suggests that spaceflight induces a physiological change in the pathogen resulting in the decreased survivability of the D. melanogaster host and that this effect can be reversed after the bacterial cells resume normal growth on the ground.",
    "results": "",
    "conclusion": "In this study, we found that flies infected with a bacterial pathogen that had been grown during spaceflight was significantly more lethal than ground controls (Fig. 1). This trend persisted in strains that had been grown in LSMMG conditions, suggesting that microgravity may be the primary factor mediating the differences in virulence seen in the spaceflight bacteria strains (Fig. 3). Interestingly, this increased lethality disappears after the first subculture is conducted on the ground, which means that the differences in virulence are short-lived and do not persist after being cultured under normal gravity conditions (Fig. 2). This is consistent with previous studies, which found that spaceflight-induced changes to pathogens, such as Bacillus subtilis; Escherichia coli; Pseudomonas aeruginosa; Staphylococcus aureus reverted upon return to Earth conditions.10 We also sought to understand whether the host immune system may be responding differently to spaceflight-altered bacteria. While it has been shown in previous studies that space-flown pathogens decrease the survival of hosts compared to their ground-reared counterparts,15,16 less is known about how the host immune system may be influenced differently by space-flown pathogens. This is also the first study in spaceflight and in simulated microgravity to evaluate microgravity-induced changes of the pathogen S. marcescens in a live host, as previous studies in the field of host-pathogen interactions have focused primarily on Salmonella15 and other microbes.48–50 Utilizing common immune pathway mutants, we determined that regardless of whether the Imd or Toll pathways were altered, infection with spaceflight sample decreases survival of flies compared to infection with ground sample of S. marcescens (Fig. 4). Studies in spaceflight and modeled microgravity have shown that when the host is exposed to microgravity conditions, the immune responses can be altered by the presence of symbiotic bacteria.51 Other studies have shown that when different pathogens are exposed to LSMMG and then tested on naive hosts, responses can vary widely depending on the specific pathogen used.52 Similarly in our study with ground-reared fly host, while there appear to be few genes that are differentially expressed after injection with spaceflight-exposed Serratia marcescens compared to the ground control bacteria, most of the highly differentially regulated genes do not appear to be directly immune-related, with the exception of Attacin (Fig. 4c, Supplementary Table 1). This antimicrobial peptide is known to respond to Gram-negative pathogens,43 so an increase in expression in response to S. marcescens is expected. However, the increase in expression in space-infected flies compared to ground-infected flies may be due to the increase in bacterial load in the space-infected individuals. Because there is a significant increase of in vivo growth seen in both spaceflight samples and LSMMG samples, it may be possible that some of these host genes may have an unknown interaction with the immune system that facilitates the faster proliferation of microgravity-experienced bacteria after infection. However given that the space-flown bacteria have faster growth kinetics in vitro (Supplementary Fig. 1) as well as in vivo, the current results indicate that the differences in lethality and survival following infection of bacteria altered by spaceflight and LSMMG are likely due to changes to the pathogen, rather than a difference in host immune response of ground-reared flies. This study is the first to demonstrate that spaceflight influences the growth and virulence characteristics of bacteria grown on a solid substrate. While many previous studies have shown that cell density and growth characteristics are altered in liquid suspension during spaceflight (reviewed in Huang et al.,53) the few studies that have cultured microbes on solid media found no difference in final cell density.54 Therefore, it was concluded that because there is no change in gravity vector for bacteria that are attached to a surface compared to those in a liquid suspension where there would be a lack of convection, that one should not expect to see a change in phenotype associated with growth on solid media in spaceflight. This argument is based on the idea that the bacteria are being affected indirectly by microgravity, due to the change in the physical properties of the liquid media that they are in, and not the effect of a change in gravity vector on the microbes themselves.55 However, Serratia marcescens is a nosocomial pathogen that can colonize a wide variety of habitats, and undergo significant phenotypic shifts depending on the properties of the growth media,56–58 including shifts in the polarity of the flagella on solid media to produce swarming cells. Because it’s thought that LSMMG may influence cell polarity in some single-celled organisms, it’s at least theoretically possible that some of these species may still be affected by microgravity at the cellular level, even on a solid substrate.59 A previous study showed that growth of E.coli and B.subtilis on agar in spaceflight did not show increased growth rates, and they did not measure virulence phenotypes of the samples.54 Therefore, it is possible that changes in phenotype in space can be manifested differently in different bacteria depending on the inherent characteristics required to colonize their normal habitat. While Wang et al.60 showed that S. marcescens did not change in physical properties on a semi-solid media in spaceflight conditions, they did provide evidence that significant transcriptomic and proteomic changes related to metabolism occurred in spaceflight sample compared to ground. We believe that these molecular and biological changes observed in S. marcescens on a semi-solid media in spaceflight provide a basis for the phenotypic changes observed in our study with bacteria grown on solid semi-defined media. While there was insufficient bacterial sample to conduct transcriptomic and proteomic analyses in the current study, a subsequent spaceflight experiment in our lab has been conducted with S. marcescens to further characterize molecular changes on both solid and liquid media types in space and will be reported separately. This indicates that media type should not be limited to liquid suspension, and that further studies using both solid and liquid media types is warranted. A study performed with a different strain of S. marcescens (ATCC 14041) in LSMMG in liquid media showed that while there was no significant change in growth parameters, there was an increase in acid stress resistance, providing further evidence for phenotypic changes of this species to microgravity and LSMMG.61 Ongoing work in our lab, including more in-depth characterization of S. marcescens under LSMMG and spaceflight conditions, are currently being conducted to further elucidate the potential molecular and physiological mechanisms affecting growth kinetics and changes in virulence seen in altered gravity. A previous study found that growth rate was not a major factor affecting the physiology and virulence of one strain S. marcescens,62 but there is speculation that growth rate and virulence may be linked due to common factors that influence both characteristics.63,64 Recent studies in humans demonstrated that slower growth rates of Bacillus pathogens actually predicted higher virulence,65 suggesting that there is conflicting data that likely varies by species and environmental factors and that growth rates may be linked to virulence. In the current study, not only was the in vitro growth at later time points significantly higher in the spaceflight strains than in the ground control strains (Supplementary Fig. 1), and there is a significant difference with in vivo growth after infection with spaceflight and ground control strains (Fig. 1b), as well as increased in vivo growth in LSMMG bacteria compared to the RWV-control (Fig. 3b). This suggests that bacteria growth rates are perhaps linked to the increased lethality between spaceflight strains and ground strains, especially since we did not find significant changes in host immune-related genes after infection with spaceflight sample compared to ground sample in wild-type ground-reared flies (Fig. 4a–f and Supplementary Table 1). Furthermore, in vitro growth was significantly higher for spaceflight samples compared to ground samples, specifically starting around hour 12, which is consistent with the in vivo increase in growth after injections (Supplementary Fig. 1). Previous studies have shown that the media composition and nutrient availability can have significant effects on growth kinetics and virulence of pathogens.16 Current studies in our laboratory are testing whether microgravity treatment confers a specific growth advantage over ground bacteria at later times in growth when specific nutrients may become limiting in the media, as well as whether or not growth kinetics can be affected by the inclusion or exclusion of specific growth factors from the media. Specifically, it may be possible that the spaceflight and LSMMG environment may confer some advantage to the bacteria when nutrients become limited, such that the low fluid shear environment allows growth to either increase or not become hindered by the decrease in nutrient in the media over time. This also emphasizes the need to understand the underlying molecular mechanisms of pathogens that are changing in LSMMG and spaceflight conditions, which has become a field of great interest recently. It has been shown that after spaceflight, there are global changes in expression of genes that may potentially be related to virulence15,17 and that some pathogens are more likely to form biofilms after exposure to spaceflight.18 Because the pathogens in the current study are also Gram-negative and are similarly opportunistic to the pathogens evaluated in previous studies, it may be expected that there are quantifiable genetic mechanisms that may be responsible for the decreased survival we found after infection. Therefore, current studies are focused on eliciting the potential underlying genetic mechanisms that are driving increased virulence.",

    "introduction": "Throughout history, humans have explored the earth, so much so, that few regions outside of the ocean depths still remain unexplored. This drive to go “where no man has gone before,” coupled with increasing pollution, climate change, and competition for scarcer resources, has brought humans to the point at which exploration and exploitation of other celestial bodies, such as the moon, asteroids, and other planets, is inevitable. However, our organ systems have evolved to work under 1g, and it is not clear what the effect of long-term exposure to lower gravity environments might be and how those effects are exerted at the cellular and molecular levels. Cardiac health has been a major concern of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) for many years, but the clinical evidence for decreased function and unmasking of asymptomatic cardiovascular disease is limited. Early studies performed on astronauts who had been in microgravity for only a few weeks to a few months failed to uncover any cardiac effects (Hamilton et al., 2011), and some studies suggested that changes in function could be explained by dehydration (Summers et al., 2005). However, the number of subjects examined in those studies was low, with sometimes conflicting results, and they were without discernable (cardiac) health risks, so it is difficult to draw conclusions. Experiments designed to mimic longer-term exposure to microgravity (bed rest in humans and hind limb unloading in mice) showed reductions in cardiac contractility (Platts et al., 2009) and increases in arrhythmia (Respress et al., 2014). Increases in ventricular contraction (QT) intervals have also been reported in astronauts after longer-duration flights (D’Aunno et al., 2003), suggesting reductions in the cardiac repolarization reserve (Akoum et al., 2011), but those conclusions are again based on few subjects with differing genetic backgrounds. Dysfunction in several cardiac ion channels are known to cause long QT syndrome (LQTS) in humans, which can lead to ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac arrest. The human ether-a-go-go-related gene, also known to code for the hERG channel, is one of the ion channels that contribute to LQTS. hERG channel dysfunction can be caused by alterations in the genes encoding this channel as well as by some commonly used medications (Sanguinetti and Tristani-Firouzi, 2006). To systematically explore the effects of spaceflight on the heart, we used the Drosophila cardiac model to examine how prolonged exposure to microgravity affects cardiac health. We report the effects of microgravity on heart function in wild-type (WT) fruit flies (Drosophila Canton-S [CS]) that were born, developed, and spent 1–3 weeks as adults aboard the International Space Station (ISS) compared with their ground-based controls (Figure 1A). We also examined the effects of microgravity on flies with mutations in seizure (sei), the fly homolog of the human hERG gene. Our results show that structural and functional cardiac remodeling occurs in response to microgravity and that remodeling is more severe in the channel mutants. Cardiac RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of WT and sei/hERG mutant flies and follow-up immunohistochemistry studies suggest that alterations in proteostasis likely contribute to the observed changes in cardiac function in microgravity.",

    "conclusion": "As humans increasingly venture into our interplanetary space, it will be important to understand the different ways in which prolonged exposure to altered g forces affect organ systems that have evolved under 1g. Muscle function is known to be affected by prolonged weightlessness, but most studies address the “bulk” properties of muscle fibers, leaving the cellular and mechanistic causes relatively unexplored. Knowledge of the biomechanical properties of filaments is important because those filaments reveal how molecular properties scale up and how bulk properties of muscle fibers are dictated by nanoscale phenomena. The current work, using the genetically tractable Drosophila model, provides new and unique insights into microgravity effects on muscle cells at the molecular level and also facilitates insightful structural and functional cardiac phenotyping at the organismal level. Similar to humans, exposure to microgravity has profound effects on fly muscle function, as has been previously reported for flies exposed to microgravity for short durations (2 weeks) (Miller and Keller, 1999). Heart function analysis in our denervated, semi-intact preparations confirmed a cardiac-specific effect of space flight, with heart chamber size and cardiac contractility and output being significantly reduced under microgravity (Figures 1B, 1D, and 1E). These findings were consistent with observed myofibrillar remodeling (Figures 3A-3D), reduced sarcomere count (Figure S3), and misregulation of sarcomeric genes (Figure 3H), including actins, myosins and tropomyosin, and sarcomere organizational genes. Troponin mutations that interfere with tropomyosin binding have already been documented in the fly heart to cause cardiac dysfunction, cardiac restriction, and myofibrillar disarray (Madan et al., 2020; Viswanathan et al., 2014), similar to our observation in space flies. In addition, we previously observed that specific myosin-transducer mutations that affect rates of ATP hydrolysis have differential effects on myofibrillar structure, including restrictive (when rates are faster) and dilatory (when rates are slower) cardiomyopathies (Cammarato et al., 2008). We have also shown that mutations in unc-45, a chaperone involved in myosin protein folding, significantly alter myofibrillar structure in the fly heart (Melkani et al., 2011). Although a role for Myo10A (Sisyphus) has not yet been described in the heart, it has been shown to promote transport of cell-adhesion cargo and to bind integrins, which we have previously shown to be critical to cardiac structure and function (Nishimura et al., 2014), thus suggesting a possible role for this unconventional myosin in the heart. Sarcomeric contractile and structural proteins provide the fundamental molecular basis for cardiac function and have well-established roles in the etiology of a variety of cardiac diseases (Marston, 2018). Our studies show that prolonged exposure to microgravity is associated with transcriptional misexpression of sarcomeric genes, cardiomyocyte myofibrillar disorganization, and ultimately, cardiac contractile dysfunction. Lack of an effect on overall chronotropy, along with an increased incidence of arrhythmia in male flies is consistent with findings in human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (Wnorowski et al., 2019). Under pathological cardiomyopathy conditions, collagen deposition is usually increased leading to fibrosis, which contributes to impaired contractility. Surprisingly, the collagen IV network that normally surrounds and attaches to the cardiomyocytes was decreased under microgravity. Remodeling occurred in both CS and, to a greater extent, in sei/hERG mutant hearts, which also exhibited intra-lumen fibrosis and collagen aggregation. These observations were consistent with misexpression of collagen and ECM maturation and degradative genes, as well as collagen and cell-adhesion-encoding genes. Although fibrosis is generally associated with cardiac disease, ECM degradation is an observed feature in both the volume-overloaded heart and in end-stage diastolic remodeling from pressure overload (Frangogiannis, 2019). ECM degradation is associated with features of contractile dysfunction, inflammation, and cardiomyocyte apoptosis, potentially due in part to loss of matrix-dependent signals that are required for preservation of function. Additionally, misregulation of ECM composition has also been implicated in cardiac disease. Taken together, ECM remodeling is a potential maladaptive effect of prolonged exposure to microgravity in our model and may be a contributing factor to the observed cardiac dysfunction. Expression of basigin, a transmembrane protein (Suzuki et al., 2016) involved in sarcomeric organization, was significantly downregulated in sei/hERG mutant hearts relative to WT at 1g, but exposure to microgravity resulted in an increased expression in sei/hERG mutants. Basigin has been shown to promote cardiac fibrosis in pressure overload models and to activate matrix metalloproteinases that degrade ECM components and thus promote ECM remodeling. This is consistent with the expression of MMP1 maintained in sei/hERG mutants compared with CS and may have a role in the dramatic collagen IV remodeling in SF sei/hERG mutant hearts. This sarcomeric modification may serve to stiffen the heart wall, allowing cardiac output to be maintained in mutants at microgravity, despite the myofibrillar remodeling and overall reduced expression of muscle structural proteins. Interestingly, basigin (CD147) has recently emerged as a potential receptor for SARS-CoV-2 (Zhou et al., 2020). Gap junctions are important intercellular connections among cardiomyocytes, allowing the organ to work as a syncytium. They are composed of connexins in vertebrates and innexins in flies. Innexin 2 and 3 have both been shown to be present in the fly heart (Cammarato et al., 2011). Under microgravity conditions innexin 2 is significantly downregulated in both CS (−1.76-fold; p = 0.002) and in sei/hERG mutant hearts (−1.59-fold; p = 0.045), whereas innexin 3 expression is altered only in sei/hERG mutants (−1.8-fold; p = 0.002). Together with the reduction in genes encoding cell-adhesion proteins, it is likely that electrotonic coupling of the myocardial cells was impaired. Another surprising finding was the significant upregulation of genes encoding nearly every subunit of the proteasome. We were able to confirm that microgravity exposure resulted in an increase in protein aggregates and associated proteasome particles on a subsequent flight. The increase in polyQ-GFP aggregates and proteasome puncta suggests that microgravity induces dramatic changes in protein turnover and/or protein misfolding. Recent evidence indicates that oligomers, such as huntingtin/PolyQ proteins, bind to and inhibit proteasomes by preventing injection of proteins into the degradation chamber (Thibaudeau et al., 2018). Additionally, proteasome dysfunction has been suggested as a causative factor and is observed in a variety of cardiomyopathies (Gilda and Gomes, 2017), heart failure, and cardiac amyloidosis (Pattison et al., 2008; Sanbe et al., 2005). We have also shown in flies that cardiac amyloidosis caused structural remodeling reminiscent of the remodeling observed in flies reared in microgravity (Melkani et al., 2013). The increase in proteosome gene and protein expression in space may reflect increased turnover of sarcomeric proteins or may be a compensatory response to the likely muted proteosome function by misfolded and aggregated proteins. This interpretation is consistent with smaller hearts and less muscle mass, as in astronauts, and could be contributing to the observed cardiac remodeling and functional defects. Interestingly, in hearts from K+ channel mutants, expression of nearly all proteasome genes was already downregulated at 1g compared with WT controls. Nevertheless, proteasome gene expression was modestly upregulated in hearts from space-reared mutants suggesting that this may be a fundamental response of cardiac muscle to lowered gravity. It is likely that this generalized increase in proteasome content underlies cardiac muscle atrophy. In contrast to the increase in proteasomes, expression of proteolytic genes was generally downregulated in microgravity. Recent quantitative analyses of human cardiac fuel usage showed that non-failing hearts undergo proteolysis and actively secrete amino acids. This process was nearly doubled in failing versus non-failing hearts (Murashige et al., 2020). It was unclear whether upregulation of proteolysis was adaptive or maladaptive. In this context, it is interesting that SF fly hearts showed decreased expression, perhaps as a reflection of an overall reduction or shift in fuel usage by the heart under microgravity. The current studies examined the effects of prolonged exposure to microgravity, whereas the exposure of astronauts is more temporally limited. However, future space exploration efforts by government and commercial ventures are focused on missions to the moon, asteroids, and Mars, and those explorations will require astronauts to spend many months and perhaps years in altered gravity. Thus, information on how prolonged microgravity exposure affects different organ systems will be critical to the success of those efforts (Criscuolo et al., 2020; Prasad et al., 2020). It is likely that, at the cellular level, there are underlying and conserved responses to altered gravity that are shared between organisms. Approximately 75% of disease-causing genes are conserved between flies and humans. Thus, the fly model can have a key role in elucidating the effects of microgravity during prolonged space flight, with significant advantages over other model systems because of its small size, its well defined and conserved genetics, and its relatively short lifespan.",

    "link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8716943/",
    "abstract": "Primary root growth is required by the plant to anchor in the soil and reach out for nutrients and water, while dealing with obstacles. Efficient root elongation and bending depends upon the coordinated action of environmental sensing, signal transduction, and growth responses. The actin cytoskeleton is a highly plastic network that constitutes a point of integration for environmental stimuli and hormonal pathways. In this review, we present a detailed compilation highlighting the importance of the actin cytoskeleton during primary root growth and we describe how actin-binding proteins, plant hormones, and actin-disrupting drugs affect root growth and root actin. We also discuss the feedback loop between actin and root responses to light and gravity. Actin affects cell division and elongation through the control of its own organization. We remark upon the importance of longitudinally oriented actin bundles as a hallmark of cell elongation as well as the role of the actin cytoskeleton in protein trafficking and vacuolar reshaping during this process. The actin network is shaped by a plethora of actin-binding proteins; however, there is still a large gap in connecting the molecular function of these proteins with their developmental effects. Here, we summarize their function and known effects on primary root growth with a focus on their high level of specialization. Light and gravity are key factors that help us understand root growth directionality. The response of the root to gravity relies on hormonal, particularly auxin, homeostasis, and the actin cytoskeleton. Actin is necessary for the perception of the gravity stimulus via the repositioning of sedimenting statoliths, but it is also involved in mediating the growth response via the trafficking of auxin transporters and cell elongation. Furthermore, auxin and auxin analogs can affect the composition of the actin network, indicating a potential feedback loop. Light, in its turn, affects actin organization and hence, root growth, although its precise role remains largely unknown. Recently, fundamental studies with the latest techniques have given us more in-depth knowledge of the role and organization of actin in the coordination of root growth; however, there remains a lot to discover, especially in how actin organization helps cell shaping, and therefore root growth.",
    "introduction": "The root system is an essential part of the plant that navigates the soil for water and nutrients. The primary root is the first organ to emerge from the seed, and therefore, its developmental plasticity is of utmost importance. The cytoskeleton is an interconnected filamentous network that is the key in controlling cell shape, rigidity, supports intracellular processes, and consists of microtubules and actin filaments (AF). AF consist of two helical strands of actin monomers that grow from the barbed plus end (compared to the pointed minus end) and rely on a plethora of actin-binding proteins to modify their organization and dynamics. Actin filaments are crucial for cell and tissue growth and participate in a large variety of processes including cell architecture and polarity establishment, signal transduction, cell-cell communication, cell division, and response to pathogens. Furthermore, the actin cytoskeleton is known to be an important player in vesicle trafficking, secretion, and endocytosis as well as endomembrane remodeling. By controlling the growth and division of cell, the actin cytoskeleton provides the means to dynamically respond to intracellular and extracellular stimuli (Mao et al., 2016; Zhu et al., 2016; Maeda et al., 2020) (Reviewed in Paez-Garcia et al., 2018; Li and Day, 2019; Takatsuka and Ito, 2020; Yang et al., 2020). The actin cytoskeleton responds to an extensive amount of stimuli, such as gravity, osmotic stress, pathogens, nutrients, and light (Henty-Ridilla et al., 2013; Leontovyčová et al., 2019) (Reviewed in Li and Day, 2019; Nakamura et al., 2019; Wang and Mao, 2019; Leontovyčová et al., 2020; Zhao et al., 2021). Plant hormones, and especially auxin, have strong effects on the composition of actin filaments (Arieti and Staiger, 2020; Reviewed in Zhu and Geisler, 2015). The actin cytoskeleton has been studied extensively; however, the role that it plays in regulating the growth of the primary root is complex and often yields conflicting data. We hereby review how actin helps root growth. We first discuss how actin filaments organize during root growth. Then, we dissect how individual components of the actin filaments and the actin-binding proteins affect root growth. Next, we describe the evidence on how the hormones controlling growth affect the actin cytoskeleton and finally we discuss how actin affects the root tropisms to gravity and light.",

    "link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4826010/",
    "abstract": "The endomembrane system plays essential roles in plant development, but the proteome responsible for its function and organization remains largely uncharacterized in plants. Here, we identified and characterized the HYPERSENSITIVE TO LATRUNCULIN B1 (HLB1) protein isolated through a forward-genetic screen in Arabidopsis thaliana for mutants with heightened sensitivity to actin-disrupting drugs. HLB1 is a plant-specific tetratricopeptide repeat domain-containing protein of unknown function encoded by a single Arabidopsis gene. HLB1 associated with the trans-Golgi network (TGN)/early endosome (EE) and tracked along filamentous actin, indicating that it could link post-Golgi traffic with the actin cytoskeleton in plants. HLB1 was found to interact with the ADP-ribosylation-factor guanine nucleotide exchange factor, MIN7/BEN1 (HOPM INTERACTOR7/BREFELDIN A-VISUALIZED ENDOCYTIC TRAFFICKING DEFECTIVE1) by coimmunoprecipitation. The min7/ben1 mutant phenocopied the mild root developmental defects and latrunculin B hypersensitivity of hlb1, and analyses of a hlb1/ min7/ben1 double mutant showed that hlb1 and min7/ben1 operate in common genetic pathways. Based on these data, we propose that HLB1 together with MIN7/BEN1 form a complex with actin to modulate the function of the TGN/EE at the intersection of the exocytic and endocytic pathways in plants.",
    "introduction": "Normal plant development relies on the endomembrane system as it plays a central role in directing the delivery of enzyme complexes and polysaccharide precursors to the cell surface and to the vacuole (Kim and Brandizzi, 2014; Kim et al., 2015). In addition, protein traffic through endomembranes is pivotal for specifying how plants respond and adapt to a range of biotic and abiotic stresses (Chen et al., 2008; Lozano‐Durán et al., 2014; Garcia de la Garma et al., 2015). The endomembrane system is highly dynamic and consists of a network of functionally interconnected organelles beginning with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) where proteins are synthesized and then trafficked to the plasma membrane (PM) and vacuole after processing and sorting in the Golgi apparatus and post-Golgi organelles (Richter et al., 2009; Brandizzi and Barlowe, 2013). Recycling and degradation of PM proteins, which also are facilitated by the endomembrane trafficking machinery, are essential for establishing and maintaining the polar localization of lipids and critical proteins, including auxin carriers, transmembrane receptors, channels, and ion transporters that regulate diverse physiological processes in plants (Geldner et al., 2007; Takano et al., 2010; Barberon and Geldner, 2014; Hachez et al., 2014; Doyle et al., 2015). Among the various organelles that comprise the endomembrane system, the trans-Golgi network (TGN) is arguably the most mysterious. The complexity of TGN function stems from the fact that it lies at the intersection of secretory and endocytic pathways, through which cargo destined for the PM and vacuole transit (Contento and Bassham, 2012; Gendre et al., 2015). In contrast to mammalian cells, there is mounting evidence that the TGN in plants functions as an early endosome (EE) that directly receives cargo taken up via endocytosis for recycling back to the PM or directed to the vacuole for degradation (Dettmer et al., 2006; Viotti et al., 2010). In recent years, much has been learned about the structure and dynamics of the plant TGN. Using transmission electron tomography on high-pressure frozen Arabidopsis thaliana roots, for example, it was shown that the formation of the TGN occurs through distinct structural changes including separation of trans-most Golgi cisterna via a peeling mechanism and secretory vesicle budding from the plane of the original trans-Golgi cisterna (Kang et al., 2011). In another study, live-cell spinning-disc confocal microscopy of Arabidopsis hypocotyl cells uncovered the formation of thin tube-like protrusions connecting two TGN/EE units prior to their homotypic fusion (Viotti et al., 2010). Furthermore, live-cell super-resolution microscopy described two types of TGN in Arabidopsis roots: a Golgi-associated TGN on the trans-side of the Golgi apparatus and a Golgi-independent TGN that moved independently of Golgi bodies (Uemura et al., 2014). In addition to new knowledge about its structure and dynamics, several protein components of the plant TGN have been discovered that mediate crucial aspects of post-Golgi membrane traffic and maintain TGN integrity. These TGN resident proteins include soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptors, the so-called SYNTAXINS of PLANTS (SYPs), vacuolar H+-ATPases, adaptor protein complexes, small monomeric GTPases of the ADP ribosylation factor (ARF) and RAS genes from rat brain (RAB) families, and the ECHIDNA/YPT/RAB GTPase complex (Dettmer et al., 2006; Chow et al., 2008; Zouhar et al., 2009; Gendre et al., 2011, 2013; Uemura et al., 2012; Asaoka et al., 2013; Naramoto et al., 2014). Whereas many of the plant TGN-localized proteins are evolutionarily conserved in eukaryotes, some appear to be unique to the plant post-Golgi trafficking machinery (Ebine et al., 2008, 2011; Fujimoto and Ueda, 2012), and it is likely that more factors remain uncharacterized. Mobility of organelles within the cell is typically driven by the cytoskeleton, a network of filamentous proteins that consists of microtubules, microfilaments, and intermediate filaments. Microfilaments, also known as filamentous actin (F-actin), assemble in an energy-dependent manner from monomeric globular actin (G-actin) units to form two-stranded, helical structures that are ∼5 to 7 nm in diameter (Li et al., 2014). The higher order organization of the actin cytoskeleton consists mostly of bundles and cables, and their assembly into these structures is specified by several actin binding proteins such as fimbrin, villin, profilin, LIM domain-containing proteins, thrumin, and crolin (Papuga et al., 2010; Whippo et al., 2011; Su et al., 2012; Jia et al., 2013; Qu et al., 2013; Sun et al., 2013). The movement and dynamics of the ER and the various organelles that make up the plant endomembrane system are largely dependent on the actin cytoskeleton, as demonstrated using actin-disrupting drugs such as latrunculin B (LatB) and cytochalasin D (Boevink et al., 1998; Nebenführ et al., 1999; Sparkes et al., 2009). However, actin appears to be dispensable for protein transport between the ER and Golgi apparatus (Brandizzi et al., 2002). While it was shown that cargo traffic from the Golgi to the vacuoles requires an intact actin cytoskeleton, the underlying mechanisms by which this process is accomplished are unknown (Kim et al., 2005). There is a wealth of information on the relationship between post-Golgi traffic and its mediation by the actin cytoskeleton in yeast and animal cells. Most of the evidence to date in these systems has pointed toward a pivotal role for F-actin and its associated regulatory and motor proteins in post-Golgi vesicle biogenesis and membrane deformation (Anitei and Hoflack, 2012). In mammalian HeLa cells, for example, myosin 1b was shown to generate the forces that regulate the assembly of F-actin foci for tubule formation at the TGN (Almeida et al., 2011). In another class of mammalian cells called 3T3, the actin-related protein 2/3 (ARP2/3) complex and their activators in the WASP (Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein) family drive the nucleation of F-actin on endosomes, which is necessary to promote endosome fission (Derivery et al., 2009). Recently, a combination of elegant optical tweezer and live-cell confocal imaging in human epithelial cells demonstrated that the actin cytoskeleton confers rigidity to the Golgi complex, making it stiffer than the surrounding cytoplasm. It was proposed that mechanical stress imposed by actin affects membrane budding and fission during intra-Golgi transport (Guet et al., 2014). In plants, several actin binding proteins appear to link actin dynamics with membrane trafficking. Many of these proteins, such as the ARP2/3 complex, profilin, formins, and capping proteins, which localize to the PM and various membranes of organelles within the endomembrane system, have orthologs in other eukaryotes (Zhang et al., 2010, 2013; Sun et al., 2013; Jimenez-Lopez et al., 2014; Cvrčková et al., 2015). In fact, some of the mechanisms by which F-actin on membranes is nucleated and polymerized in plants mirror those of animals and yeast, where small GTPases of the Rho family directly activate membrane-localized actin nucleators (Takenawa and Suetsugu, 2007). For example, genetic and biochemical studies in Arabidopsis showed that a Rho of plants (ROP)-guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) protein called SPIKE1 regulates F-actin polymerization through the ARP2/3 complex (Basu et al., 2008; Zhang et al., 2010). Recently, a number of plant-specific proteins that function as actin membrane adaptors have been uncovered. One example is RISAP, a TGN-localized ROP-GTPase effector that interacts with F-actin and binds to the globular tail domain of myosin XI in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) pollen tubes. RISAP is ∼33% identical to the Arabidopsis family of myosin binding proteins at the amino acid level (Peremyslov et al., 2013). It was proposed that the RISAP-mediated interaction between the actin cytoskeleton and endomembrane system is an essential component of the tip growth machinery in pollen tubes (Stephan et al., 2014). Another family of plant-specific proteins that mediate actin-endomembrane crosstalk is the 13-member Networked (NET) proteins. These NET proteins interacted directly with F-actin through a conserved N-terminal domain. The NET proteins were also shown to localize to PM-ER contact sites and the tonoplast (Deeks et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2014). Here, we report the discovery of a plant-specific protein called HLB1 (for HYPERSENSITIVE TO LATRUNCULIN B1) through a forward-genetic screen in Arabidopsis seedlings for mutants that exhibited differential responses to the inhibitory effects of LatB on primary root growth. We determined that HLB1 tracks along F-actin and colocalizes with the TGN/EE in vivo and that hlb1 has marked defects in the recycling of proteins to the PM after endocytic uptake. Furthermore, we identified the ARF-GEF, MIN7/BEN1 (Nomura et al., 2006; Tanaka et al., 2009), as an HLB1 interactor and showed that hlb1 functions in a common genetic pathway as min7/ben1 in regard to LatB hypersensitivity despite their opposite effects on membrane trafficking. These findings are significant because they support the conclusion that HLB1 represents a class of plant-specific proteins that function at the crossroads of exocytic and endocytic trafficking pathways, possibly through mechanisms coordinated by the actin cytoskeleton.",

    "conclusion": "The endomembrane system is essential for normal plant cell development, yet many protein components that modulate its function remain to be identified. The distinct effects of cytoskeleton-disrupting chemicals on plant growth provide the basis for convenient forward-genetic screens to isolate mutants with altered sensitivity to these compounds. However, such screens have rarely been applied for studies on the plant cytoskeleton despite their strong potential to uncover mechanisms underlying the cytoskeletal basis of plant development. Forward-genetic screens to isolate mutants that respond differentially to cytoskeleton-disrupting compounds have been limited to those that alter microtubules (Naoi and Hashimoto, 2004; Paredez et al., 2008). Here, we used a forward-genetic approach with the potent actin-disrupting compound LatB and identified the recessive mutant hlb1, which displayed enhanced LatB sensitivity compared with the wild type. We determined that HLB1 encodes a six TPR motif-containing protein with a conserved C-terminal domain. We found that HLB1 is a plant-specific protein that could potentially link the actin cytoskeleton with post-Golgi traffic. Loss of function of HLB1 leads to alterations in protein recycling to the PM and to an F-actin network that is more susceptible to actin-specific chemical antagonists. This, in turn, results in seedlings with root hair polarity defects and reduced primary root growth. We demonstrated that HLB1 associates with the TGN/EE through its conserved C-terminal domain and functions with the TGN/EE-localized ARF-GEF protein MIN7/BEN1 (Nomura et al., 2006; Tanaka et al., 2009) in overlapping endomembrane trafficking pathways. These data provide important insight into a previously undescribed component of the endomembrane trafficking machinery that is highly conserved and unique to land plants.",

    "link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7010715/",
    "abstract": "When positioned horizontally, roots grow down toward the direction of gravity. This phenomenon, called gravitropism, is influenced by most of the major plant hormones including brassinosteroids. Epi-brassinolide (eBL) was previously shown to enhance root gravitropism, a phenomenon similar to the response of roots exposed to the actin inhibitor, latrunculin B (LatB). This led us to hypothesize that eBL might enhance root gravitropism through its effects on filamentous-actin (F-actin). This hypothesis was tested by comparing gravitropic responses of maize (Zea mays) roots treated with eBL or LatB. LatB- and eBL-treated roots displayed similar enhanced downward growth compared with controls when vertical roots were oriented horizontally. Moreover, the effects of the two compounds on root growth directionality were more striking on a slowly-rotating two-dimensional clinostat. Both compounds inhibited autotropism, a process in which the root straightened after the initial gravistimulus was withdrawn by clinorotation. Although eBL reduced F-actin density in chemically-fixed Z. mays roots, the impact was not as strong as that of LatB. Modification of F-actin organization after treatment with both compounds was also observed in living roots of barrel medic (Medicago truncatula) seedlings expressing genetically encoded F-actin reporters. Like in fixed Z. mays roots, eBL effects on F-actin in living M. truncatula roots were modest compared with those of LatB. Furthermore, live cell imaging revealed a decrease in global F-actin dynamics in hypocotyls of etiolated M. truncatula seedlings treated with eBL compared to controls. Collectively, our data indicate that eBL-and LatB-induced enhancement of root gravitropism can be explained by inhibited autotropic root straightening, and that eBL affects this process, in part, by modifying F-actin organization and dynamics.",
    "introduction": "Plants are sessile organisms that are limited by their location. As such, they have evolved sensitive and delicate ways to respond to environmental cues allowing them to reprogram their growth when presented with changes in their surroundings. One of the adaptive behaviors that plants exhibit in response to external signals is the ability to redirect the growth of their major organs towards or away from a perceived stimulus. These phenomena, collectively called tropisms, shape the above and belowground architecture of the plant. One of the most widely studied tropisms is gravitropism, which describes the growth of shoots and roots away or toward the gravity vector, respectively. Gravity perception occurs in the columella cells located in the root cap or endodermal cells in shoots. Columella and endodermal cells contain starch-filled amyloplasts, called statoliths, which sediment to the lower side of the cell when the plant is reoriented relative to the gravity vector (Sack, 1997; Tasaka et al., 1999; Kiss, 2000). The physical signal triggered by statolith sedimentation is transduced to the growing regions of the organ resulting in differential growth between the upper and lower sides (Blancaflor and Masson, 2003; Sato et al., 2015). Plant organs typically have a defined gravitropic set point angle (GSA). Although the GSA of a specific organ is influenced by the developmental stage of the plant and other environmental cues, it is under tight genetic control allowing for the maintenance of a defined growth angle relative to gravity when other external signals are kept constant. For instance, under carefully controlled laboratory conditions, the main shoot axis typically grows vertically upward (negative gravitropism) with a GSA of 180˚ and the primary root grows vertically downward (positive gravitropism) with a GSA of 0˚. Lateral roots and shoot branches typically have a GSA between these values (Firn and Digby, 1997). Recently, mechanisms underlying GSA of plant organs that exhibit non-vertical growth, such as lateral roots and shoot branches, have been shown to be dependent on auxin and plant nutritional status (Roychoudhry et al., 2013; Roychoudhry et al., 2017). Most studies on gravitropism have focused on understanding biological processes that lead to the initial redirection of organ growth when the plant is reoriented. However, gravitropism has been viewed as a composite response that includes restrained or anti-gravity growth readjustment in which the organ eventually straightens after the initial growth redirection. The latter phenomenon is known as autotropic straightening or autotropism (Stankovic et al., 1998a; Stanković et al., 1998b). Although it is well established that the initial gravitropic response (i.e. downward root growth and upward shoot growth) is modulated by auxin redistribution (Swarup et al., 2001; Rakusova et al., 2015), there is accumulating evidence that most of the major plant hormones participate in gravitropism through overlapping signaling pathways (Guisinger and Kiss, 1999; Lofke et al., 2013; Vandenbussche et al., 2013; Pernisova et al., 2016). By contrast, little is known about the underlying mechanisms regulating autotropism. It has been debated whether induction of autotropic straightening is triggered by gravity itself (Myers et al., 1995) or as an autonomic counter response to gravitropic bending (Tarui and Iino, 1999; Bastien et al., 2013; Okamoto et al., 2015). It has also been suggested that the term autotropism should be used exclusively in situations when plant organs straighten after withdrawal of the gravity stimulus through randomization of the gravity vector on a clinostat or in microgravity (Stanković et al., 1998b). The cytoskeleton has been proposed to play major roles in all phases of gravitropism (Blancaflor, 2002; Bisgrove, 2008). Microtubules and filamentous-actin (F-actin) are the core protein components of the cytoskeleton, and their dynamics and higher order organization within the cell are defined by many regulatory proteins (Blancaflor, 2013). Most studies implicating the cytoskeleton in gravitropism have employed pharmacological approaches in which roots or shoots were exposed to cytoskeletal inhibitors, and the subsequent response of the organ to a horizontal reorientation was quantified (Blancaflor, 2002). Interestingly, such approaches have revealed that chemical inhibitors of F-actin such as latrunculin B (LatB) or cytochalasin B can elicit stronger gravitropic responses in shoots and roots (Blancaflor and Hasenstein, 1997; Yamamoto and Kiss, 2002; Blancaflor et al., 2003; Hou et al., 2003; Hou et al., 2004). The stronger gravitropic response of roots and shoots after treatment with F-actin antagonists was recapitulated in Arabidopsis thaliana mutants disrupted in vegetative actin isoforms (Kato et al., 2010; Lanza et al., 2012). Furthermore, the A. thaliana shoot gravitropic response9 (sgr9) mutant, which had reduced shoot gravitropism and statolith sedimentation, could be rescued by LatB treatment (Nakamura et al., 2011). Recently, delayed root gravitropism in A. thaliana actin-related protein 3 (arp3) mutants was linked to abnormal amyloplast sedimentation and bundled F-actin in the columella cells. The delay in root gravitropism was reversed by LatB exposure (Zhou et al., 2016). It was postulated that actin disruption promoted gravitropism by increasing gravity sensing potential through unimpeded statolith sedimentation (Blancaflor, 2013). However, this hypothesis remains to be tested experimentally. As noted, gravitropism is modulated by most of the major plant hormones, but in the context of past actin inhibitor studies, brassinosteroid is the plant hormone that is of most interest. Like LatB, eBL promoted gravitropism in shoots and roots (Meudt, 1987; Kim et al., 2000; Li et al., 2005; Kim et al., 2007; Lanza et al., 2012). The effect of eBL on root gravitropism was explained primarily through its interaction with auxin (Kim et al., 2000; Kim et al., 2007). In A. thaliana, eBL induced the accumulation of the auxin efflux carrier PIN-FORMED 2 (PIN2) protein in the root elongation zone (Li et al., 2005). The effect of eBL on PIN2 accumulation was proposed to involve the actin cytoskeleton through an increase in the expression domains of ROP2 (for Rho of Plants), a small GTPase regulator of F-actin dynamics (Li et al., 2005). Furthermore, it was shown that exogenous eBL treatment altered both actin organization and PIN2 polar localization in A. thaliana roots in a manner similar to that of auxin (Lanza et al., 2012). Taken together, the actin cytoskeleton appears to be a component of the signaling pathways by which eBL promotes gravitropic growth responses in plants. The promotive effect of LatB and eBL on gravitropism has been explained primarily in regard to their impact on gravity sensing events or on the differential growth responses resulting from altered auxin redistribution (Hou et al., 2003; Hou et al., 2004; Li et al., 2005; Lanza et al., 2012; Blancaflor, 2013). However, a recent study with A. thaliana mutants disrupted in genes encoding the actin motor protein myosin presents an alternative hypothesis to explain the LatB- or eBL-induced enhancement of root gravitropism. The apparent promotion of tropistic organ responses brought about by altered actin function may instead be due to its inhibition of the autotropic straightening response (Okamoto et al., 2015). In the study by Okamoto et al. (2015), inflorescence stems of A. thaliana myosin XI mutants bent strongly when the initial gravity stimulus was withdrawn by clinorotation, an observation that mirrored the persistent curvature of Z. mays roots treated with LatB (Hou et al., 2003). Here, we show that eBL-treated roots exhibited persistent curvature responses when the initial gravity response was withdrawn by clinorotation in a similar manner as LatB-treated roots. Our results indicate that the apparent promotion of root gravitropism by eBL can be explained by its inhibitory effect on autotropic straightening that resulted, in part, from eBL-mediated alterations in F-actin dynamics and organization.",

    "conclusion": "In this paper, a slowly-rotating 2-D clinostat was used to gain additional insights into actin-mediated regulation of directional root growth. These experiments showed that brassinosteroids were involved in modulating directional root growth, in part, by modifying the organization and dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton. This conclusion was based on the observation that exogenous application of eBL and LatB triggered similar enhanced root gravitropism and amplified root coiling on a clinostat (Figure 1). The curvature responses of roots treated with eBL and LatB during continuous gravistimulation and on a clinostat are reminiscent of the behavior of inflorescence stems of A. thaliana myosin XI and actin8 mutants (Kato et al., 2010; Okamoto et al., 2015; Talts et al., 2016). The hyperbending of inflorescence stems of myosin and actin A. thaliana mutants was proposed to be the result of inhibited autotropism. With an aberrant acto-myosin system in fiber cells, it was proposed that the stems could no longer perceive their posture to initiate a straightening response (Okamoto et al., 2015). Here, we propose that a similar mechanism may be operating in roots, and that eBL is a component of the root organ straightening response through its impacts on F-actin. Most of the studies implicating the actin cytoskeleton in gravitropism have emphasized its role in the gravity perception phase (Blancaflor, 2013; Su et al., 2017). In gravity sensing cells such as the columella, actin has been proposed to interact with amyloplasts to facilitate conversion of the physical gravity signal to a biochemical signal (Zheng et al., 2015). Because actin inhibitors such as LatB or mutations to genes encoding actin itself led to stronger root gravitropic curvature (Yamamoto and Kiss, 2002; Hou et al., 2003; Kato et al., 2010; Lanza et al., 2012), it was proposed that the unrestrained sedimentation of amyloplasts may amplify the gravity sensing signal leading to a more robust graviresponse (Blancaflor, 2013). However, work on A. thaliana myosin XI mutants (Okamoto et al., 2015) and results presented here, suggest a more prominent role for actin in the graviresponse phase, and more specifically in the autotropic straightening response that enables plant organs to correct their orientation (Stankovic et al., 1998a; Stanković et al., 1998b). Furthermore, given the difficulties in obtaining clear images of F-actin in the columella (Figure 3), we cannot rule out the possibility that a secondary mechanism of gravity sensing in the root transition zone might be affected by LatB (Wolverton et al., 2002). A number of studies have implicated eBL in directional root growth control. For instance, eBL application mirrored the enhanced root waving and gravitropism of A. thaliana actin2 mutants and caused disruptions in F-actin configurations in wild type (Lanza et al., 2012). Enhanced root gravitropism was also observed in wild-type A. thaliana roots treated with eBL and this process was proposed to be mediated by ROP2-dependent modification of F-actin assembly and disassembly (Li et al., 2005). While our results expand on these previous observations, experiments with a clinostat implicated eBL as a potential regulator of autotropism, and like previous results with LatB-treated roots, provide an alternative explanation of why this hormone has an apparent promotive effect on gravitropism. Although previous studies have shown that eBL modifies F-actin organization in A. thaliana roots (Lanza et al., 2012), we found that eBL effects on F-actin organization in fixed Z. mays roots and living M. truncatula roots were not as pronounced and consistent as those induced by LatB. Higher concentrations of eBL were needed to elicit distinct qualitative and quantitative changes in F-actin in both chemically-fixed Z. mays roots and living M. truncatula roots. In fact, it was surprising to find that 1 µM eBL led to increased F-actin occupancy values compared to controls, while concentrations lower (500 nM) or higher (5 µM) than 1 µM led to reduced values (Figure 2B). Moreover, F-actin occupancy and bundling in living roots treated with 5 µM eBL was not different from untreated controls (Figures 5B, C). LatB-treatment on the other hand, led to an increase in F-actin bundling, which was likely due to aggregation of F-actin fragments in some of the root cells analyzed. Although occupancy and bundling were not affected by eBL, we found that eccentricity of F-actin in LatB- and eBL-treated roots were reduced relative to controls (Figure 5D). It is tempting to speculate that eBL-induced reduction in F-actin alignment alone is sufficient to account for a large part of the root autotropic inhibition observed here. It is important to note, however, that all of the F-actin analyses reported here were conducted pre-clinorotation. It is possible that changes in F-actin organization during the process of clinorotation were unaccounted for in our analyses. Experiments involving chemically fixing roots at various time points during clinorotation or a system in which live roots expressing the F-actin reporters can be imaged on a clinostat, will be necessary to address such possibilities. Okamoto et al. (2015) proposed that the long F-actin cables in the inflorescence stem fiber cells were the structures that modulated organ straightening possibly by regulating cytoplasmic streaming. It is possible that eBL regulation of root autotropic straightening is facilitated by a population of F-actin in specific root cell types that are not detected by the quantitative metrics used in our studies. This could explain why eBL had only modest effects on overall F-actin organization, but still caused LatB-like autotropic straightening defects. Another possibility is that dampening of global F-actin dynamics by eBL as revealed by live cell imaging of etiolated M truncatula hypocotyls could account for autotropic straightening defects. Suppressed global F-actin dynamics after eBL exposure could modify targeting of plasma membrane-associated proteins, such as PIN2, leading to dampened autotropism (Li et al., 2005; Lanza et al., 2012). Unfortunately, we were unable to obtain global F-actin dynamic data on M. truncatula root cells because of technical difficulties associated with keeping actively growing roots within the microscope field of view. As such, a direct link between root F-actin dynamics and root autotropism is missing. For the future, a suitable clinostat assay using M. truncatula shoots should help clarify if reduced global F-actin dynamics can explain eBL effects on organ straightening. Furthermore, live fluorescent protein-based F-actin marker lines in Z. mays could help strengthen the link between F-actin organization and autotropic organ growth (Wu et al., 2013). For more than a decade, genetically-encoded F-actin reporters based on fluorescent protein technology have advanced our understanding of actin function during plant development (Voigt et al., 2005; Wang et al., 2008). In addition to new insights into the processes underlying directional root growth control, our work introduces a set of M. truncatula lines expressing two types of genetically encoded F-actin reporters. These new F-actin reporter lines could potentially be used to address a range of biological questions. Specifically, a future gravitational biology-related study in which these new M. truncatula lines would be of value is the dynamic monitoring of F-actin in various tissues of graviresponding roots using vertical stage microscopy (Von Wangenheim et al., 2017). Vertical stage microscopy combined with new imaging modalities such as airy scan should enable super-resolution of F-actin during plant gravity response (Komis et al., 2018). Moreover, some light sheet microscopy platforms allow for plant organs to be positioned vertically. Such methods pave the way for long term and volumetric imaging of F-actin dynamics during plant gravity response using these new M. truncatula lines (Ovečka et al., 2018). Similar to previous reports in A. thaliana plants expressing live cell F-actin reporters (Ketelaar et al., 2004; Dyachok et al., 2014), mature M. truncatula plants expressing Lifeact-mGFP and GFP-ABD2-GFP appear to have growth defects based on their reduced shoot and root dry weights when compared to controls. However, the negative growth effects induced by expressing these reporters were mild and not very pronounced in young seedlings. Thus, if used with caution, these Lifeact-mGFP and GFP-ABD2-GFP M. truncatula lines should be a valuable addition to existing fluorescent protein-based toolkit for studying dynamic cellular processes in legumes (Ivanov and Harrison, 2014; Cvrckova and Oulehlova, 2017; Zhang et al., 2019). In conclusion, our results implicate brassinosteroids in root autotropism. Brassinosteroids modulate this process by modifying F-actin organization and dynamics in a manner different from that of the actin-disrupting compound LatB. Regardless of the mechanisms by which eBL modifies F-actin, our studies reinforce previous observations that the acto-myosin system is an important component of plant tropistic responses. Finally, through our work, we introduced a set of M. truncatula lines expressing fluorescent protein-based reporters that could enable new studies of actin-mediated processes in legumes.",

    "link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7503278/",
    "abstract": "Cytoplasmic calcium ([Ca2+]cyt) is a well-characterized second messenger in eukaryotic cells. An elevation in [Ca2+]cyt levels is one of the earliest responses in plant cells after exposure to a range of environmental stimuli. Advances in understanding the role of [Ca2+]cyt in plant development has been facilitated by the use of genetically-encoded reporters such as GCaMP. Most of these studies have relied on promoters such as Cauliflower Mosaic Virus (35S) and Ubiquitin10 (UBQ10) to drive expression of GCaMP in all cell/tissue types. Plant organs such as roots consist of various cell types that likely exhibit unique [Ca2+]cyt responses to exogenous and endogenous signals. However, few studies have addressed this question. Here, we introduce a set of Arabidopsis thaliana lines expressing GCaMP3 in five root cell types including the columella, endodermis, cortex, epidermis, and trichoblasts. We found similarities and differences in the [Ca2+]cyt signature among these root cell types when exposed to adenosine tri-phosphate (ATP), glutamate, aluminum, and salt, which are known to trigger [Ca2+]cyt increases in root cells. These cell type-targeted GCaMP3 lines provide a new resource that should enable more in depth studies that address how a particular environmental stimulus is linked to specific root developmental pathways via [Ca2+]cyt.",
    "introduction": "Calcium (Ca2+) plays a vital role as a second messenger system in plant development and stress response. Because Ca2+ acts as a stress signal, it is one of the first responses plants have to environmental stimuli. This fast response is achieved through an influx of extracellular Ca2+ and an efflux of stored Ca2+ from the vacuole, endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and mitochondria that is achieved via a concentration gradient between the intracellular Ca2+ stores and the cytoplasm [1]. In non-stimulated conditions, the concentration of Ca2+ in the cytoplasm rests around 100 nM [1,2,3]. This low concentration is maintained through H+/Ca2+ antiporters and Ca2+-ATPases that move Ca2+ into the apoplast or into intracellular stores [3,4]. Once the response in the cell is initiated, the cell will return to homeostasis by storing excess Ca2+ back in the vacuole, ER, or mitochondria through active transport [2], or by pumping it out into extracellular space through gated-ion channels in the plasma membrane. Once Ca2+ enters the cytoplasm in high concentrations, it binds with Ca2+-binding proteins to initiate a second messenger cascade [4,5]. Part of this signaling cascade is the activation of Ca2+-dependent protein kinases and the regulation of transcription factors to increase tolerance to the stress that caused the initial Ca2+ response. Much of our understanding about Ca2+ as a second messenger has come from the development of technologies that enable monitoring of free cytosolic Ca2+ ([Ca2+]cyt) changes in living cells. Early on, these technologies consisted of indicator dyes that had to be chemically or physically loaded into the cell, such as Calcium Green or Indo-1. When Ca2+ levels in the cell became elevated upon exposing the cell to a specific stimulus, these indicator dyes increased fluorescence [6]. However, use of these indicator dyes in plant cells were often met with technical challenges including uneven dye loading, loss of cell viability after dye loading, and cells failing to take up the dyes [6,7]. Problems with these early indicator dyes were mitigated with the discovery of a suite of fluorescent proteins from jellyfish and other marine organisms [8,9]. Using molecular cloning techniques, selected regions of Ca2+-binding proteins could be fused with these fluorescent proteins to generate genetically-encoded Ca2+ sensors that change conformation upon Ca2+ binding [8]. Ca2+ binding induced changes in the conformation of fluorescent protein-based sensors result in enhanced fluorescence emission. One example of a genetically-encoded Ca2+ sensor is GCaMP. GCaMP consists of an enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) fused to calmodulin (CaM) and myosin light-chain kinase (M13) [1,10]. GCaMP3 is a modified form of GCaMP that features a circularly permutated enhanced GFP (eGFP) flanked by CaM and M13 that gives low fluorescence in the absence of Ca2+, which increases upon reversible binding of Ca2+ to the CaM domain [11]. To date, expression of CGaMP and other genetically-encoded Ca2+ sensors in plants are driven by constitutive promoters such as Cauliflower Mosaic Virus 35S (35S) and Ubiquitin 10 (UBQ10) [12,13]. Although plant lines constitutively expressing genetically-encoded Ca2+ sensors enabled the functional study of [Ca2+]cyt changes across entire plant organs [5,13,14], it is likely that each cell type within the organ is characterized by a unique [Ca2+]cyt signature. While [Ca2+]cyt changes typically observed in the entire plant organ likely originate from more than one cell type, we lack tools to monitor these changes within specific tissues or cells [15]. To address this need, we generated a set of lines in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, expressing GCaMP3 targeted to the columella, endodermis, epidermis, cortex, and trichoblast using cell-type specific promoters [16]. We demonstrate the utility of these new GCaMP3 lines in reporting cell-type [Ca2+]cyt changes in roots treated with chemicals previously shown to induce [Ca2+]cyt increases in plants.",
    "results": "",
    "conclusion": "In this paper, we introduced a set of A. thaliana lines expressing the intensiometric [Ca2+]cyt reporter GCaMP3 targeted to specific root cell types. Roots of these cell type specific GCaMP3 lines responded to chemical treatments such as ATP, glutamate, Al3+, and NaCl by exhibiting increases in [Ca2+]cyt-dependent CGaMP3 fluorescence. Imaging [Ca2+]cyt changes in cell types in response to some of these chemicals using lines in which genetically-encoded [Ca2+]cyt reporters are expressed ubiquitously have been attempted previously. This was done by drawing a region of interest corresponding to a particular tissue/cell type. For example, it was shown that Al3+-induced biphasic [Ca2+]cyt signatures in the root elongation zone occurred predominantly in the cortex when compared with the epidermis [5]. While this has proven effective for marking developmental regions along the longitudinal axis of the root [5,27], specifying a region of interest to designate root tissue/cell types along the radial axis for fluorescence-based measurements of [Ca2+]cyt can be problematic because this does not guarantee complete separation of signals from adjacent cell types. This problem becomes even more challenging for cell types located in the innermost regions of the root such as the columella and endodermis. Moreover, the ability to consistently draw a region of interest to outline the root cortex requires that the root grew in a particular orientation during the imaging experiments [5]. Here, we documented some of the advantages of the cell type specific GCaMP3 lines by comparing [Ca2+]cyt signatures from ROIs marking presumptive columella and endodermis in UBQ10:GCaMP3 lines with those of ATHB8:GCaMP3 and SCR:GCaMP3. This analysis revealed stark differences in both the amplitude and shape of [Ca2+]cyt signatures. Differences were also uncovered when equivalent root developmental regions were compared, particularly with regard to the amplitude of [Ca2+]cyt signatures in the meristem (Figure 8). The differences are likely due to contaminating signals from other cell types in UBQ10:GCaMP3 lines. The use of cell type specific GCaMP3 lines described here could potentially mitigate such problems. The [Ca2+]cyt transients in the cell type specific lines induced by these various chemicals had various patterns when compared with lines in which GCaMP3 was expressed ubiquitously. A similarity in patterns occurred within the root surface cells’ responses to the different chemical treatments and again within the root inner cell types. Lines in which GCaMP3 was expressed in innermost root cell types such as the columella and endodermis generally had slower response times when compared to lines with GCaMP3 expressed in root surface cells. The delayed response times in lines with GCaMP3 expressed in the columella and endodermis was observed in all chemical treatments (Table 1; Figure 6). One could argue that because of the innermost location of the columella and endodermis, the delay in the response times might be due to the longer time it takes for the chemical to make contact with the target cells. The fact that columella and endodermis exhibit minimal or no [Ca2+]cyt increase after application of 0.5X MS supports this possibility. An alternative hypothesis is that the delayed [Ca2+]cyt response in the innermost cell types is due to an inward moving [Ca2+]cyt wave, which is not easily revealed when GCaMP3 is expressed ubiquitously or on the root surface. From our data, these inward-directed [Ca2+]cyt waves appear to be most prominent in ATP- and glutamate-treated roots (Figure 3, Figure 4 and Figure 7). The GCaMP3 lines described here could present a significant tool for better understanding the radial direction of [Ca2+]cyt waves in roots. A meaningful set of experiments with GCaMP3 lines expressed in innermost cell types will be to locally apply a small volume of the chemical stimulus to the root epidermis. The line that was most similar to UBQ10:GCaMP3 with regard to chemical-induced [Ca2+]cyt transients was PIN2:GCaMP3. This was not surprising given that the PIN2 promoter drives GCaMP3 expression in root epidermal cells, which is the cell type that is readily imaged in UBQ10:GCaMP3 lines due to its location on the root surface. With the PEP:GCaMP3 lines described here, we were able observe biphasic, triphasic and oscillatory [Ca2+]cyt signatures after Al3+ treatment that were reminiscent of some of the observations made by Rincon-Zachary et al. (2010) [5] (Figure 5). The cortex- and trichoblast-targeted GCaMP3 lines also revealed an earlier onset of NaCl-induced [Ca2+]cyt transients when compared to UBQ10:GCaMP3 lines (Figure 6). It has been shown that [Ca2+]cyt transients in roots exposed to NaCl is part of the cellular machinery that prevents root cells from rupturing under salinity stress. The plasma membrane-localized receptor-like kinase, Feronia (FER), is required for root growth recovery after encountering high salinity conditions [31]. Because fer mutants displayed a high incidence of cortical cell rupture when compared to wild type after exposure to NaCl, it is tempting to speculate that earlier onset of [Ca2+]cyt transients in the cortex revealed by the PEP:GCaMP3-expressing lines could be a mechanism to maintain root growth integrity. The cell type GCaMP3 lines described here should be useful in testing this hypothesis. While testing the various cell type specific GCaMP3 lines, we encountered a number of technical challenges brought about by our seedling growth conditions. In several experiments, we found that applying the 0.5X MS control solution alone could trigger a rise in [Ca2+]cyt. The MS only-induced [Ca2+]cyt transients were most prominent in the UBQ10:GCaMP3-expressing lines and those in which GCaMP3 was expressed in root surface cell types (e.g., PIN2:GCaMP3 and PRP3:GCaMP3). The [Ca2+]cyt transients observed after MS treatment were reminiscent of touch-induced [Ca2+]cyt responses [20], and recent studies on ATP-induced [Ca2+]cyt signaling [27], suggesting that we might have been eliciting a touch response as the various solutions were added to the root. In support of this hypothesis, our method for root [Ca2+]cyt imaging involved planting seed of the reporter lines on a thin layer of agarose to secure the root while at the same time allowing for the root cells to be accessible to the various chemical treatments ([5]; see Methods). It is possible that some of the [Ca2+]cyt transients observed in response to MS application resulted from roots that were not securely anchored to the agarose medium. Alternatively, the prevalence of MS-induced [Ca2+]cyt increases in some of our experiments could be due to osmotic changes when the solution was applied. Because agar for imaging roots was poured in advance, it was possible that liquid in some of the plates may have evaporated during storage. This could have led to some plates having an MS solution that was more concentrated than the treatment solution. To test the possibility that MS-induced [Ca2+]cyt changes were due to touch or hypoosmotic shock, we repeated the ATP application experiments using roots that emerged from seeds planted on plates with freshly prepared MS-supplemented agarose. Furthermore, roots were pretreated with MS solution prior to ATP treatment. Under these modified growth and treatment conditions, we found that MS-induced [Ca2+]cyt increases were significantly dampened (Figure 3 and Figure 7). Given that [Ca2+]cyt changes are responses that can be elicited by a wide range of stimuli, the results described here highlight the need to carefully consider the growth and treatment conditions, and to include appropriate controls when conducting [Ca2+]cyt imaging experiments. Based on these observations, it is imperative that fresh plates be prepared prior to planting the reporter lines and that roots be pretreated with the solvent control solution for a few hours to allow seedlings to adapt. Some studies have shown [Ca2+]cyt signals propagate along the longitudinal axis of roots [5,26]. Meanwhile, another study has indicated that [Ca2+]cyt signal propagation from the apical into the sub-apical can also occur [27]. The cell type specific GCaMP3 lines described here, particularly those lines in which GCaMP3 is expressed in inner root cells such as the cortex-, endodermis- and columella-specific lines could shed new insights into the direction of [Ca2+]cyt signal propagation within the roots. The MS-induced [Ca2+]cyt responses in lines in which GCaMP3 was expressed in the endodermis and columella were not observed. However, these cell types exhibited [Ca2+]cyt increases in response to some of the chemicals, indicating that these [Ca2+]cyt changes can be attributed to the chemical itself. In this regard, it is noteworthy that columella-targeted GCaMP3 lines did not exhibit a [Ca2+]cyt increase after Al3+ treatment while those lines with GCaMP3 expressed in the endodermis lacked a [Ca2+]cyt response to NaCl. With the establishment of response patterns from the cell type specific GCaMP3 lines when exposed to various chemical treatments, investigation into unique aspects of different root tissues/cells, such as signal propagation direction and response intensity, can be more readily explored.",

    "abstract": "Root hairs are single-cell protrusions that enable roots to optimize nutrient and water acquisition. These structures attain their tubular shapes by confining growth to the cell apex, a process called tip growth. The actin cytoskeleton and endomembrane systems are essential for tip growth; however, little is known about how these cellular components coordinate their activities during this process. Here, we show that SPIRRIG (SPI), a beige and Chediak Higashi domain-containing protein involved in membrane trafficking, and BRK1 and SCAR2, subunits of the WAVE/SCAR (W/SC) actin nucleating promoting complex, display polarized localizations in Arabidopsis thaliana root hairs during distinct developmental stages. SPI accumulates at the root hair apex via post-Golgi compartments and positively regulates tip growth by maintaining tip-focused vesicle secretion and filamentous-actin integrity. BRK1 and SCAR2 on the other hand, mark the root hair initiation domain to specify the position of root hair emergence. Consistent with the localization data, tip growth was reduced in spi and the position of root hair emergence was disrupted in brk1 and scar1234. BRK1 depletion coincided with SPI accumulation as root hairs transitioned from initiation to tip growth. Taken together, our work uncovers a role for SPI in facilitating actin-dependent root hair development in Arabidopsis through pathways that might intersect with W/SC.",
    "introduction": "Root hairs are single-cell tubular projections that emerge from root epidermal cells. Root hairs increase the effective surface area of the root system by extending laterally into soil pores, thus enabling increased access to nutrients and water (Carminati et al., 2017; Ruiz et al., 2020). Root hairs have been studied extensively by plant biologists for decades because they serve as excellent models to unravel mechanisms by which cell size and shape in plants are regulated (Grierson et al., 2014). To attain their cylindrical shapes, root hairs undergo tip growth, a process in which expansion of the cell is confined to its apical domain. Tip growth involves a balance between the directed delivery of post-Golgi compartments carrying protein complexes and cell wall building blocks to the cell apex and localized cell wall loosening and recycling of excess membranes. Besides root hairs, tip growth is exhibited by other cell types such as pollen tubes, fungal hyphae, and rhizoids of mosses, liverworts, and algae (Bascom et al., 2018a).",

    "conclusion": "Our work uncovers important insights into the mechanism underlying actin-mediated root hair development. A major result from our studies is the revelation that SPI is a root hair tip-localized protein. Although SPI fused to fluorescent proteins was reported to localize to endosomes and P-bodies, such studies have been limited to transient expression assays in biolistically bombarded leaves (Steffens et al., 2015, 2017). As such, a mechanistic link between reported SPI subcellular localization patterns and cell growth phenotypes (i.e. short root hairs and distorted trichome shapes) described in the original spi mutant alleles has been unclear. The large size of SPI and the possibility that it is targeted to discrete cellular domains could have hindered transgenic complementation and subsequent in planta localization efforts. Through our work, we demonstrated that a SPI-YPet fusion generated through recombineering complemented spi (Zhou et al., 2011; Brumos et al., 2020). In doing so, we provide compelling evidence that SPI is a root hair tip-enriched BEACH domain-containing protein. Our studies indicate that SPI mediates root hair tip growth by maintaining the tip-focused fine F-actin meshwork, although the precise mechanism by which this is accomplished is unknown. The root hair tip-focused F-actin meshwork is the functional equivalent of domain-specific actin structures found in other tip-growing cells, such as cortical actin fringes in pollen tubes and actin spots in moss protonemata (Bascom et al., 2018a). Although the tip-focused F-actin meshwork was able to form in a population of spi root hairs, it often dissipated or was replaced by thick actin cables, a feature of mature wild-type root hairs that are terminating tip growth. Although the presence of tip-focused SPI-YPet was strongly correlated with the maintenance of the tip-focused F-actin meshwork, direct causal links between SPI and F-actin have yet to be established. An alternative explanation is that tip growth-induced reduction due to the absence of SPI could lead to downstream, indirect effects on actin organization. The root hair phenotypes and corresponding depletion of tip-focused F-actin in spi is reminiscent of studies of BEACH domain-containing proteins in mammalian cells, particularly in neurons, which have often been compared to tip-growing plant cells (Baluška, 2010). For instance, neuronal dendritic spines are cytoplasmic protrusions that modulate excitatory synaptic transmission in the mammalian nervous system. Actin is a major component of dendritic spines that plays a central role in driving the dynamic shape changes and secretory activities of these cytoplasmic protrusions during synaptic signaling (Cingolani and Goda, 2008). In animals, neurobeachin (Nbea) is a BEACH domain-containing protein that has a similar domain architecture to SPI. Cultured neurons of Nbea mice knockouts had fewer dendritic spine protrusions and depleted F-actin at the synapse than the wild-type (Niesmann et al., 2011). Another BEACH domain-containing protein called FAN was shown to be crucial for the formation of filopodia, i.e. actin-rich plasma membrane extensions that enable motile cells to probe their environment (Mattila and Lappalainen, 2008). FAN-deficient fibroblasts had reduced filopodia formation and were unable to reorganize their actin cytoskeletons in response to upstream activation by tumor necrosis factors (Haubert et al., 2007). Taken together, these results indicate that actin-mediated regulation of cell polarity by BEACH domain-containing proteins is likely to be conserved across animals and plants. The formation of SPI-YPet agglomerates in response to BFA indicates that SPI is associated with post-Golgi compartments. This result is consistent with observations made with BEACH domain-containing proteins in mammals. For example, Nbea was shown to localize to vesicular endomembranes adjacent to the TGN, and like SPI, the distribution of Nbea-positive post-Golgi compartments was altered by BFA (Wang et al., 2000). Furthermore, the Caenorhabditis elegans (nematode) Nbea homolog SEL-2 was demonstrated to function in endomembrane trafficking in polarized epithelial cells based on the finding that sel-2 mutants mistarget proteins normally found in the apical cell surface to the basolateral surface (de Souza et al., 2007). Here, the protein secretory marker SEC-RFP, which is typically trafficked to the tips of elongating wild-type root hairs (Sparks et al., 2016), was uniformly distributed in spi root hairs. The absence of tip-directed SEC-RFP gradients in spi root hairs shows that, as in mammals, plant BEACH domain-containing proteins are required for the proper targeting of molecular cargo to points of polarized cell growth. Another significant result from our studies is the discovery that BRK1 and SCAR2 are molecular determinants of the RHID. The localization of BRK1 and SCAR2 to the RHID and their dissipation as root hair tip growth commenced contrasts with findings in Physcomitrium in which a functional BRK1-YFP distinctly labeled the tips of caulonemal cells (Perroud and Quatrano, 2008). Like BRK1-YFP, an ARPC4-GFP construct labeled the tips of caulonemal cells (Perroud and Quatrano, 2008), whereas no clear tip-focused labeling of ARPC5-GFP was observed in root hairs (Supplemental Figure S5). The observation that BRK1-YFP prominently localized to the RHID but dissipated during active root hair tip growth was surprising given that Arabidopsis BRK1 complemented the defective filamentous growth of Physcomitrium BRK1 knockouts (Perroud and Quatrano, 2008). Physcomitrium BRK1 and ARPC4 mutants have clear tip growth defects, while Arabidopsis mutants in the W/SC and ARP2/3 complexes have only weak to no tip growth abnormalities (Le et al., 2003; Mathur et al., 2003; Perroud and Quatrano, 2006, 2008). This suggests that seed plants might have evolved a specialized function for the W/SC complex at the site of root hair emergence and early bulge formation with only a minor role in driving actin-dependent tip growth. Moreover, a recent discovery regarding the emergence of an ARP2/3 independent W/SC pathway in the regulation of F-actin dynamics for sperm nuclear migration in Arabidopsis pollen tubes further indicates that this occurrence may be more common in seed plants. On the other hand, the knockouts of an Arabidopsis SPI ortholog in the liverwort Marchantia polymorpha led to short rhizoids, indicating that SPI has conserved functions across land plants in regulating tip growth (Honkanen et al., 2016). In other single cell types such as diffusely growing trichomes, W/SC and ARP2/3 subunits likely play a more prominent role than SPI based on their more severe trichome phenotypes when the expression of their encoding genes is suppressed. The weakening of BRK1-mRuby3 fluorescence coinciding with SPI-YPet accumulation, and the persistence of SPI-YPet signal in spi root hair tips, provides indirect evidence that SPI might play a role in mediating BRK1 stability or localized clustering at the plasma membrane of the RHID. Although it is unknown why BRK1-YFP signal persists in spi, it is tempting to speculate that SPI might modulate BRK1 via protein degradation pathways. This possibility is supported by studies in mammals pointing to a role for BEACH domain-containing proteins in protein degradation via the ubiquitination pathway. In mouse models, for example, the BEACH domain-containing protein WDR81 was shown to be essential for the removal of autophagy-dependent ubiquitinated proteins (Liu et al., 2017). In this regard, it is worth noting that the W/SC-ARP2/3 pathway was demonstrated to function in stress-induced autophagy (Wang et al., 2016) and that proteasome inhibitors stabilized SCAR during dark-induced primary root growth inhibition (Dyachok et al., 2011). It is possible that SPI-mediated proteolytic pathways and BRK1 coordinate their activities to specify the levels of W/SC at the RHID that enable the transition to actin-dependent rapid tip growth. However, such a scenario is complicated by the observation that the formation of tip-directed SPI-YPet does not appear to require BRK1. This suggests that SPI’s appearance at the root hair tip is likely regulated by other factors besides the W/SC complex. Alternatively, the failure of BRK1 to disappear from the RHID in spi mutants may be caused by a general failure to transition to normal tip growth. Future studies will require subjecting root hairs to conditions that prematurely terminate tip growth to determine if BRK1 signals persist. In summary, our work provides data that contribute to our understanding of actin-mediated root hair development. A crucial result from our work is the discovery that SPI and the W/SC subunits BRK1 and SCAR2 exhibit polarized localization patterns in root hairs that point to potential functional relationships among these proteins during root hair development. In the future, it will be important to evaluate genetic interactions between SPI and W/SC and ask whether SPI physically interacts with actin or subunits of W/SC to better explain the functional links between SPI and W/SC.",

    "abstract": "Long-duration spaceflight creates a variety of stresses due to the unique environment, which can lead to compromised functioning of the skeletal and immune systems. However, the mechanisms by which organisms respond to this stress remain unclear. The present study aimed to investigate the impact of three different gravitational loadings (microgravity, 1/6 g [lunar gravity], and 1 g) on the behavior, bone, thymus, and spleen of mice housed for 25–35 days in the International Space Station. The bone density reduction under microgravity was mostly recovered by 1 g but only partially recovered by 1/6 g. Both 1 g and 1/6 g suppressed microgravity-induced changes in some osteoblast and osteoclast marker gene expression. Thymus atrophy induced by microgravity was half recovered by both 1 g and 1/6 g, but gene expression changes were not fully recovered by 1/6 g. While no histological changes were observed due to low gravity, alterations in gene expression were noted in the spleen. We found that in bone and thymus, lunar gravity reduced microgravity-induced histological alterations and partially reversed gene expression changes. This study highlighted organ-specific variations in responsiveness to gravity, serving as an animal test for establishing a molecular-level gravity threshold for maintaining a healthy state during future spaceflight.",
    "introduction": "Space exploration has attracted attention in various fields, including materials, fuels, communication equipment, systems, medicine, and botany. To further explore space, the manned lunar exploration program “Artemis” has been initiated, and research is underway to address the various obstacles to the space environment1,2. Notably, astronauts experience various environmental challenges during spaceflight including microgravity, psychological stress, and high space radiation. These changes pose significant threats to the various physiological functions of astronauts. A prolonged stay in space induces changes, such as the deterioration of bones3,4, skeletal muscle function3, vestibular control5, optic nerve papillary edema6, and cardiac hypertrophy7 among astronauts. These health issues are mainly managed through effective exercise in space; however, the mechanisms causing these changes are unknown. Several drawbacks must be considered for humans to explore space. In addition, it is difficult to verify effects on the human space environment. Research activities at the International Space Station (ISS) have been conducted on various microorganisms, plants, and animals8. To stably house mice, which are higher life forms, on the ISS, we developed breeding facilities in accordance with animal ethics guidelines, and housed mice on the ISS for approximately one month on five occasions, including the mission reported here, and all mice returned to Earth alive. To conduct space exploration, we must understand biological effects at the molecular level to adapt to space environments such as gravity on the Moon and Mars. It is important to study the effects of long-term gravitational fluctuations on living organisms, to prepare for future space exploration. In 2016, we successfully housed 12 mice in the ISS under either microgravity or artificial 1 g for 35 days using the Multiple Artificial-gravity Research System (MARS), which can exhibit varying gravitational forces using a centrifugal device (Mouse Habitat Unit (MHU)-1 mission)9,10. All the mice were alive after returning to Earth. The success of the MHU mission has been reported in the effects of microgravity on various organs, including skeletal muscles10,11, bone10, eye12, spleen13, thymus14, reproductive system15,16, and behavior17,18. For future manned exploration of the Moon and Mars, it is necessary to understand the effects of partial gravity of less than 1 g on living organisms. Recently, the effects of lunar gravity on mice have been explored using MARS with two different short- and long-radius centrifuge lengths on the ISS (the MHU-4 and -5 missions in 2019 and 2020, respectively). Here, analysis of the soleus muscle of mice revealed that muscle atrophy and muscle fiber type might be regulated by different gravitational forces19. This study aimed to present the physiological effects of three different gravity environments on mice during three MHU missions (MHU-1, -4, and -5), based on histological characteristics and gene expression. We found that lunar gravity suppressed histological changes in the thymus, partially recovered bone mass loss, and partially recovered microgravity-induced changes in gene expression in bone, thymus, and spleen. Furthermore, the responsiveness to gravity varied in different organs; this research will serve as an animal test to elucidate the gravity threshold for each organ at the molecular level required to maintain a healthy state for future space travel.",

    "title": "S. aureus MscL is a pentamer in vivo but of variable stoichiometries in vitro: implications for detergent-solubilized membrane proteins",
    "link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2998437/",
    "abstract": "While the bacterial mechanosensitive channel of large conductance (MscL) is the best studied biological mechanosensor and serves as a paradigm for how a protein can sense and respond to membrane tension, the simple matter of its oligomeric state has led to debate, with models ranging from tetramers to hexamers. Indeed, two different oligomeric states of the bacterial mechanosensitive channel MscL have been resolved by X-ray crystallography: The M. tuberculosis channel (MtMscL) is a pentamer, while the S. aureus protein (SaMscL) forms a tetramer. Because several studies suggest that, like MtMscL, the E. coli MscL (EcoMscL) is a pentamer, we re-investigated the oligomeric state of SaMscL. To determine the structural organization of MscL in the cell membrane we developed a disulfide-trapping approach. Surprisingly, we found that virtually all SaMscL channels in vivo are pentameric, indicating this as the physiologically relevant and functional oligomeric state. Complementing our in vivo results, we purified SaMscL and assessed its oligomeric state using three independent approaches (sedimentation equilibrium centrifugation, crosslinking, and light scattering) and established that SaMscL is a pentamer when solubilized in Triton X-100 and C8E5 detergents. However, performing similar experiments on SaMscL solubilized in LDAO, the detergent used in the crystallographic study, confirmed the tetrameric oligomerization resolved by X-ray crystallography. We further demonstrate that this stoichiometric shift is reversible by conventional detergent exchange experiments. Our results firmly establish the pentameric organization of SaMscL in vivo. Furthermore they demonstrate that detergents can alter the subunit stoichiometry of membrane protein complexes in vitro; thus, in vivo assays are necessary to firmly establish a membrane protein's true functionally relevant oligomeric state.",
    "introduction": "The bacterial mechanosensitive channel MscL serves as a biological “emergency release valve,” allowing rapid loss of solutes in response to a sudden decrease in the osmolarity of a bacterium's environment [1]. It is perhaps the best characterized mechanosensor [2], thus serving as a paradigm of how a membrane protein can detect and respond to mechanical forces [3]. Ironically, something as simple as the stoichiometry of the MscL complex has plagued the field with debate since its inception. The original model for the E. coli MscL (EcoMscL) stoichiometry was a homo-hexameric organization, which was suggested by crosslinking and the study of tandem subunits [4]. This model then appeared to be supported by low-resolution two-dimensional crystallization of EcoMscL [5]. But the subsequent elucidation of the M. tuberculosis channel (MtMscL) by X-ray crystallography [6] then suggested a pentameric organization, at least for this orthologue. This result led to a re-evaluation of EcoMscL stoichiometry [6],[7], which supported a pentameric organization and brought into question whether the two-dimensional crystallization data could be fit by 5-fold as well as 6-fold symmetry. Thus, the field transiently seemed to have settled that MscL was most likely a pentamer. However, the recent crystallographic structure of the S. aureus homolog (SaMscL) reveals a tetramer variant [8]. This latter finding has again raised questions regarding the true oligomeric state of MscL and evokes the possibilities either that MscL from different species assemble into complexes with different stoichiometries or that the channel exists as multiple functional oligomeric complexes in the cell membrane. Therefore, we set out to identify the MscL oligomeric state in the cell membrane and to understand how the SaMscL channel, which shares approximately 40% sequence identity with EcoMscL and MtMscL [8], could exist in the non-pentameric subunit organization resolved by X-ray crystallography. We found not only that the true in vivo oligomeric state of SaMscL is a pentamer but also that at least one detergent, LDAO, artificially but reversibly reorganizes this structure into a tetrameric stoichiometry.",
    "results": "With multiple oligomeric states identified in vitro, we devised a disulfide-trapping strategy to identify the oligomeric state of MscL in bacterial membranes. Using this approach, we were able to directly measure the subunit stoichiometry of SaMscL in vivo by generating a series of double-cysteine mutants in regions predicted to be in close proximity from both existing crystal structures (Figure 1A). These modifications allow crosslinking in the cell membrane via disulfide bonds as previously described [9],[10]. Briefly, the cells were osmotically shocked in the presence of the oxidizing agent copper-phenanthroline, centrifuged, and then immediately resuspended in SDS loading buffer to avoid unnecessary manipulation of the proteins. As we previously observed [9], osmotic shock increased disulfide bridging, presumably because reductants including glutathione and thioredoxin are released from the cell [11], thus decreasing the reducing potential of the cytosol. The protein content of the lysed cells was evaluated using SDS-PAGE and molecular weight standards. For the L10C/L89C or L10C/M91C SaMscL channels, we were able to observe efficient in vivo disulfide trapping (Figure 1B). For the L10C/L89C protein, a range of oligomeric states was observed, a pentamer being the maximal state. However, for the L10C/M91C protein, one primary band was observed that reflects a pentameric complex. These data demonstrate that the pentamer is by far the major species within the cell membrane and thus appears to be the true structural and functional unit in vivo.",
    "conclusion": "Essentially all previous structural studies on MscL, as with most membrane proteins, have been performed on channels that have been solubilized, under the assumption that detergents do not alter the subunit stoichiometry. Our data examining the effect of different detergents on the oligomeric state of SaMscL have far-reaching implications for membrane protein research, as we now clearly demonstrate that changes in oligomeric state can and do occur upon detergent solubilization, and these alterations are not easily detected by SEC (see Figures 3C and 4B). To circumvent these artifacts associated with solubilization, we have developed an in vivo cross-linking assay. Although the pentamer is by far the major product observed in Figure 1B, very small amounts of smaller oligomers can be resolved upon overloading of protein gels and long Western blot exposures. The small amount of tetramers and smaller complexes observed upon long exposure could be incompletely assembled protein or may simply be due to the lack of disulfide bridging, which is rarely observed to be this efficient (e.g. see [9],[10]). In addition, we cannot completely rule out the possibility that oligomerization is a dynamic and even reversible process in vivo. Regardless, it seems unlikely that oligomeric species smaller than pentamers have a physiological role given that there are tens of channels per cell [14], and the smaller species compose only a few percent of the total channels. Our data definitively show that the vast majority of the SaMscL channel adopts a pentameric structure in the cell membrane, consistent with the MtMscL crystal structure [6], but incompatible with the SaMscL crystal structure [8]. A close inspection of the recent tetrameric SaMscL structure, which was speculated to be in an expanded gating intermediate state, reveals structural interactions between residues in TM1 and TM2 residues of a neighboring subunit similar to those in the closed MtMscL structure. This result was surprising because several studies using various techniques have suggested TM1 undergoes a significant clockwise rotation (as viewed from the periplasmic side) upon channel gating. The approaches supporting this interpretation include: spin labeling combined with electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) studies [15], accessibility of sulfhydryl reagents to cysteine mutants in TM1 upon gating [16],[17], accessibility of heavy metals to engineered binding sites in the pore [18], suppression mutagenesis demonstrating interactions between TM1 and TM2 upon gating [19], and confirmation of multiple interaction sites between TM1 and TM2 upon gating by using an electrostatic repulsion approach as well as disulfide trapping [10]. Both the EPR studies as well as the heavy-metal binding in the pore strongly suggest that this rotation occurs quite early in the gating process, before ion permeation. By this model, V21 and G24 (V23 and G26 in EcoMscL) should rotate away from the pore constriction, allowing V22 and the positively charged K29 (I24 and K31 in EcoMscL) to line the open pore. The observation that this rearrangement has not occurred strongly suggests that the crystal SaMscL structure actually reflects a strained closed state due to improper oligomeriazation, rather than an expanded intermediate state. The observed stoichiometry changes in detergents also evoke questions regarding how membrane protein subunits assemble into physiological multimeric complexes. A previous report on EcoMscL demonstrated that when the protein is translated in vitro in the absence of any lipid or detergent and is subsequently purified in the presence of Triton X-100, the channel spontaneously assembles into pentamers [20]. A separate study demonstrated that even synthetically synthesized EcoMscL will oligomerize into functional channels when incorporated into lipid membranes [21]. These studies demonstrate that the EcoMscL channel has the ability to self-assemble into the functional oligomer in vitro. Similarly, it appears that C8E5 and Triton X-100 allow SaMscL to properly fold and assemble into a pentameric structure, which correlates with the observed oligomeric state in vivo. In contrast, LDAO reorganizes SaMscL into tetramers that do not appear to exist in significant quantities in vivo, suggesting that they are not physiologically relevant. The observed self-assembly properties of EcoMscL under many conditions, combined with the reversible nature of the detergent-induced oligomeric state changes for SaMscL, may explain why Liu et al. observed channel function for the LDAO solubilized SaMscL tetramers [8]; presumably, once the tetrameric LDAO-solubilized SaMscL is reconstituted into lipids, it rearranges back into functional pentameric structures. The crystal structure of the SaMscL was derived from a truncation mutant in which several amino acids at the C-terminus had been removed [8]. One previous study suggested that at least some C-terminus deletions of EcoMscL could lead to the formation of larger aggregates when translated in a cell-free system [22]. While we cannot rule out the possibility that the SaMscL deletion contributed to the stabilization of the tetramer in the crystal, our data do demonstrate that detergents alone can stabilize alternative oligomeric states of the full-length SaMscL in solution. Our observations make it tempting to speculate that larger, more hydrated head groups (i.e. the head groups of C8E5 and Triton X-100) promote pentamer formation, while smaller head groups (i.e. LDAO) promote tetramer formation. However, with such a small number of detergents tested thus far, additional experiments will be required to identify what chemical properties of the detergents cause the oligomeric state change and what effect, if any, lipids may have on the stabilization of specific oligomeric states. In sum, our data demonstrate that the physiologically active SaMscL oligomer in vivo is a pentamer and that purification in detergents can cause a reorganization of the SaMscL channel's oligomeric state. Our findings also show that SEC alone is insufficient to evaluate the usefulness of a particular detergent for the study of membrane proteins; ideally, SEC-MALS and/or analytical ultracentrifugation should be correlated with in vivo experiments that can more confidently determine the functional and physiologically relevant oligomeric state of membrane proteins.",

    "title": "Manipulating the permeation of charged compounds through the MscL nanovalve.",
    "link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3005423/",
    "abstract": "MscL is a bacterial mechanosensor that serves as a biological emergency release valve, releasing cytoplasmic solutes to the environment on osmotic downshock. Previous studies have recognized that this channel has properties that make it ideal for use as a triggered nanovalve for vesicular-based targeted drug-release devices. One can even change the modality of the sensor. Briefly, the introduction of charges into the MscL pore lumen gates the channel in the absence of membrane tension; thus, by inserting compounds that acquire a charge on exposure to an alternative stimulus, such as light or pH, into the pore of the channel, controllable nanoswitches that detect these alternative modalities have been engineered. However, a charge in the pore lumen could not only encourage actuation of the nanopore but also have a significant influence on the permeation of large charged compounds, which would thus have important implications for the efficiency of drug-release devices. In this study, we used in vivo and electrophysiological approaches to demonstrate that the introduction of a charge into pore lumen of MscL does indeed influence the permeation of charged molecules. These effects were more drastic for larger compounds and, surprisingly, were related to the orientation of the MscL channel in the membrane.—Yang, L-M, Blount, P. Manipulating the permeation of charged compounds through the MscL nanovalve.",
    "introduction": "",
    "results": "It has been assumed that, because of its large pore size, MscL has no ionic preference. Therefore, for this study, we initially sought to determine whether this was indeed the case. We recorded from inside-out patches obtained from giant bacterial spheroplasts, as described previously (21). Using asymmetric conditions, as described in Materials and Methods, the I/V plot of wild-type MscL was generated, and its reversal potential was determined. Figure 1 shows that wild-type MscL has a positive reversal potential of 0.57 ± 0.09 mV. This finding is much closer to the Cl− reversal potential (17.5 mV) than the reversal potential for K+ (−27.8 mV), thus indicating an anionic preference.",
    "conclusion": "In sum, the data demonstrate that, although MscL has a large channel pore (30–40 Å; ref. 8), modifying the charge profile of its pore-forming TM1 domain could either increase or decrease the anionic preference of the channel. Moreover, gating the MscL channel by the insertion of charges can drastically influence the permeation of larger charged compounds, and that this influence depends on the orientation of the channel. These findings have important implications when designing a drug-release device from an engineered MscL nanopore, as previously proposed (13, 14, 31, 32). To avoid inhibiting the permeation of specific charged drugs or other compounds, one might want to consider the charge used to gate the pore. However, in many instances this might be impractical. For example, low pH is one of the main intrinsic properties that can be found in cancer tissues and inflammation sites in the body, and hence is a common target for triggered drug-delivery devices. However, for such a purpose, a pH-sensitive MscL nanovalve could only be gated by a positive-charge introduction into the channel pore, which could inhibit the release of positively charged drug compounds. Alternatively, it would be advantageous to control the orientation of the nanopore in the vesicular release device. Normally, the insertion of MscL into liposomal membranes is random (33). However, the direction of a synthetic peptide reconstituted into liposomes has been controlled by inserting a polyethylene glycol (PEG) chain at its end (34). The C terminus of MscL appears to be tolerant to truncation and insertion of tags (16, 17, 35) and thus might be an appropriate location for the addition of such a PEG label, allowing for a cytoplasmic-side-out orientation in a liposome reconstitution system. In this orientation, a charge introduction in the pore would have less influence on the efflux of charged molecules. For both the light sensor and pH sensors previously described (13, 14), the orientation of the sensor might not matter, given that light, and even protons with time, can penetrate the membrane. In addition, it has been reported that a histidine substituted at G22 is accessible to cytoplasmic protons (12). Furthermore, the addition of a PEG group is not likely to be deleterious to the vesicular device; PEG lipids are used routinely in what are termed “stealth vesicles,” because they allow for the evasion of opsonization and uptake by the reticuloendothelial system, and thus have an extended half-life within an organism (36, 37). Overall, nanocarriers are emerging platforms for cancer therapy, and yet the challenge remains in selectively binding and targeting cancer cells (38). Because it has the potential to release therapeutic compounds within or near target tissues on specific stimuli, a controllable MscL nanovalve with high efflux efficiency would be a step toward a selective and efficient nanocarrier.",

    "abstract": "The mechanosensitive channel of large conductance (MscL) from E. coli serves as an emergency release valve allowing the cell to survive acute osmotic downshock. It is one of the best studied mechanosensitive channels and serves as a paradigm for how a protein can sense and respond to membrane tension. Two MscL crystal structures of the orthologs M. tuberculosis and S. aureus have been solved showing pentameric and tetrameric structures, respectively. Several studies followed to understand whether the discrepancy in their stoichiometry was a species difference or a consequence of the protein manipulation for crystallization. Two independent studies now agree that the full-length S. aureus MscL is actually a pentamer, not tetramer. While detergents appear to play a role in modifying the oligomeric state of the protein, a cytoplasmic helical bundle has also been implicated. Here, we evaluate the role of the C-terminal region of S. aureus MscL in the oligomerization of the channel in native membranes by using an in vivo disulfide-trapping technique. We find that the oligomeric state of S. aureus MscLs with different C-terminal truncations, including the one used to obtain the tetrameric S. aureus MscL crystal structure, are pentamers in vivo. Thus, the C-terminal domain of the S. aureus protein only plays a critical role in the oligomeric state of the SaMscL protein when it is solubilized in detergent.",
    "introduction": "The E. coli mscL was the first gene definitively shown to encode a mechanosensitive channel activity.1 The encoded mechanosensitive channel of large conductance (MscL) protein (EcoMscL) is one of the best studied mechanosensitive channels, serving as a paradigm for how a protein can sense membrane tension.2 A crystal structure from M. tuberculosis MscL (MtMscL) was first obtained by Douglas Rees' group in 1998, depicting what appeared to be a closed state of the channel.3,4 It was a homopentamer with each subunit containing two transmembrane domains and a cytoplasmic C-terminal α-helical bundle. The same group recently obtained a second crystal structure from a C-terminal truncated S. aureus MscL (SaMscL) in what they speculated to be an expanded intermediate state; surprisingly, this was a tetramer.5 A different oligomeric state was unexpected given that the two orthologs are highly conserved [Fig. 1(A)], as is the entire MscL family.6–8 To further investigate the discrepancy between the stoichiometry of these two channels, several studies have been performed. In one study, we developed an in vivo disulfide-trapping assay to determine the state of the S. aureus channel when in its native membrane environment; it was unambiguously a pentamer, demonstrating that the crystal did not reflect a native state of the protein.9 Thus, two possibilities existed: either the truncation of the C-terminal bundle altered channel stoichiometry to tetramer, or the detergent solubilization did. Using crosslinking, sedimentation equilibrium centrifugations and light scattering, we concluded that on solubilization with the detergent n-dodecyl-N,N-dimethylamine-N-oxide (LDAO), which was used to obtain the crystal structure, the channel reversibly reorganizes as a tetramer; in contrast, TritonX-100 and pentaethylene glycol monooctyl ether (C8E5) detergents did not alter stoichiometry.9 However, the influence of protein truncation was not assessed. Indeed, one previous study of in vitro translated and n-Octyl-Beta-D-Glucopyranoside (OG) solubilized EcoMscL implied that the C-terminal end of the protein played a critical role in assembly.10 Recently, using a new technique coined oligomer characterization by addition of mass (OCAM), the Rees' group confirmed that both MtMscL, and full length (FL) SaMscL are pentamers when solubilized in n-Dodecyl β-D-maltoside (DDM); but they also showed that a SaMscL with the C-terminal deletion, as used in the crystallographic study, was heterogeneous in its oligomeric state, existing as both pentamers and tetramers. Thus, it appeared that the C-terminal helical bundle does influence the oligomeric state of the protein. However, because both of these studies used detergent-solubilized proteins, it was unclear if the C-terminal region of the protein played a role in MscL stoichiometry in vivo. Here, we utilize our in vivo disulfide-trapping assay to address this issue.",

X-ray crystallography reveals a homo-pentameric complex with each subunit containing two transmembrane α-helices (TM1 and TM2) and a single carboxyl terminal α-helix arranging within the complex to form a five-fold cytoplasmic bundle (CB), whose function and stability remain unclear. In this study, we show three routes that throttle the open channel conductance. When the linker between the TM2 and CB domain is shortened by deletions or constrained by either cross linking or heavy metal coordination, the conductance of the channel is reduced; in later two cases, even reversibly. While having implications for the stability of the CB, these data also provide routes for engineering MscL sensors that are more versatile for potential nanotech devices.",

    "abstract": "The bacterial mechanosensitive channel of large conductance, MscL, is one of the best characterized mechanosensitive channels serving as a paradigm for how proteins can sense and transduce mechanical forces. The physiological role of MscL is that of an emergency release valve that opens a large pore upon a sudden drop in the osmolarity of the environment. A crystal structure of a closed state of MscL shows it as a homopentamer, with each subunit consisting of two transmembrane domains (TM). There is consensus that the TM helices move in an iris like manner tilting in the plane of the membrane while gating. An N-terminal amphipathic helix that lies along the cytoplasmic membrane (S1), and the portion of TM2 near the cytoplasmic interface (TM2ci), are relatively close in the crystal structure, yet predicted to be dynamic upon gating. Here we determine how these two regions interact in the channel complex, and study how these interactions change as the channel opens. We have screened 143 double-cysteine mutants of E. coli MscL for their efficiency in disulfide bridging and generated a map of protein-protein interactions between these two regions. Interesting candidates have been further studied by patch clamp and show differences in channel activity under different redox potentials; the results suggest a model for the dynamics of these two domains during MscL gating.",
    "introduction": "The bacterial mechanosensitive channel of large conductance (MscL) of E. coli is to date one of the best studied mechanosensitive channels serving as a paradigm for how channels sense and respond to mechanical stimuli.1 The physiological role of MscL in bacteria is osmoregulation2; upon a sudden decrease in the osmolarity of the environment (hypo-osmotic shock) water enters the bacterial cell, producing cell swelling and creating tension in the membrane. MscL gates in response to this membrane tension3 acting as an emergency release valve that allows the rapid flow of water and solute and preventing cell lysis. MscL opens a large pore, estimated size of 30 Å4 in response to membrane tensions close to the lytic value of the membrane.5 A crystal structure of MscL from the homolog M. tuberculosis has been solved at 3.5 Å resolution6,7 (Fig. 1). It reflects what is thought to be a closed state of MscL, although much data now suggests it may not reflect the totally closed state seen in vivo.1,8,9 The channel is a homopentamer with each subunit consisting of two transmembrane domains. Both the C and N-terminals have been shown to be cytoplasmic. Although a second structure exists for the S. aureus ortholog showing a tetrameric oligomerization,10 further studies have since shown that this ortholog is actually pentameric in vivo, and that the tetrameric re-organization is a detergent-specific process11,12; hence, only the pentameric structure is discussed here.",
    "results": "In this work we study protein-protein interactions between S1 (S2-M12) and TM2ci (F93-K105) residues in E. coli MscL channel (Fig. 1) by using an in vivo disulfide trapping assay.17 We chose to perform this in vivo assay because it involves little or no manipulation of the protein and is therefore more likely to reflect real protein-protein interactions, eliminating possible artifacts occurring during protein purification. Briefly, bacteria expressing each double mutant were grown in high salt media and either diluted in media of the same osmolarity (control) or lower osmolarity (osmotic down-shock) with the oxidizing agent copper-phenanthroline. After a brief incubation the bacteria were pelleted, resuspended in sample buffer, run in an electrophoresis gel and visualized in a western blot with a MscL antibody. Interestingly, we found that interactions between S1 and TM2ci domains are so efficient that only 1.5 µM copper-phenanthroline had to be used in order not to saturate the screen. To compare the likelihood of interactions between cysteine substituted residues from S1 and TM2ci domains, we measured the amount of protein existing as monomer through pentamers in western blots. We expressed the values as the percentage of multimers vs. the total protein. For the multimer value we counted only the trimers to pentamers because some single cysteine mutants in S1 can form dimers,15 thus leading to ambiguity. The 3D graph in Figure 2 summarizes our results. The X and Y axis are the residues from S1 (residues 2 to 12) and TM2ci (residues 93 to 105) regions respectively, and the z axis reflects the percentage of total protein existing as multimers for each double cysteine mutant. Note that the graph shows a pattern where almost no multimer formation occurs between S1 and residues A95, M94 and F93, residues that are inside the membrane of TM2, while the strongest interactions occur between K105 to L102 and S1.",
    "conclusion": "MscL has been shown in previous studies to be, in general, quite tolerant of cysteine mutations.9 Perhaps partially because of this finding, cysteine trapping experiments have been utilized to address proximity of regions of the protein that are thought to interact. However, in some instances, researchers have been misled by utilizing targeted mutagenesis and disulfide trapping experiments, proposing models later shown to be false. For example, S1 was thought at one time to form a helical bundle that served as a second gate.18,19 The major form of evidence for this model was targeted disulfide trapping. However, when the entire region was scanned and disulfide trapping assessed and compared,15 the results were consistent with the newly re-evaluated structure7: S1 was an amphipathic helix running along the cytoplasmic membrane. There was no evidence that a S1 “second gate” was ever formed during the gating process. We have designed the experiments used in this study to avoid some of the many potential pitfalls of the disulfide trapping approach. First, we have not used a targeted approach. Instead, we have generated and screened 143 double cysteine mutants, which act as controls for each other; relative amounts of disulfide bridging can easily be assessed. Second, the amount of oxidant used was carefully titrated to yield the maximum range of disulfide bridging; none of the interactions were forced by high concentrations of oxidant. Indeed, the amounts used in this study are 100 times less than that used to study TM1/TM2 interactions, where the interactions may be more insular and transient upon gating.17 Finally, we use an in vivo approach in which the membrane proteins are not solubilized prior to being resuspended in SDS running buffer; hence disulfide bridges cannot form in mild detergents that would preserve the pentameric complex while possibly allowing more dynamic interactions not reflecting any normal physiological state. We believe that the following of these practices when utilizing a disulfide trapping approach yields a more true and interpretable set of data. Our current model for S1 function is that it serves as a stabilizer for the twisting and turning of the pore-forming first transmembrane domain.15 In addition, all current models for the structural changes that occur upon gating include a tilting of both transmembrane domains within the plane of the membrane. In addition to tilting, for TM1 several lines of evidence also suggest a clockwise “corkscrewing” of TM1 of almost 180°, as would be observed from the periplasm; these lines of evidence include EPR experiments,20 disulfide trapping experiments within the pore9 and between TM1 and TM2 upon gating,17 accessibility and gating influences of the sulfhydryl reagent MTSET+ on TM cysteine mutants,21,22 and the engineering of heavy metal binding sites within the pore region.8 The S1 amphipathic helix, with its two conserved phenylalanines, is joined to this dynamic TM1 by a conserved flexible glycine residue at position 14 that has been shown to have functional significance.9,23 Such a helix running along the membrane is observed in many channels including the other mechanosensitive channel in bacteria, MscS,7,24 the “slide helix” of KirBac1.1,25 a putative amphipathic “gate anchor” domain studied in TRPY1,26 and several others where they may also serve as stabilizers. Although TM2 is not thought to “corkscrew” within the membrane, it is thought to tilt within it upon gating. Indeed, a recent study of the dynamics of the TM2ci region has shown that channel gating can be influenced by modifications that make this region more hydrophobic.27 One residue, N103, was even shown to transiently insert into the membrane during the gating process in a piston-like manner. Hence, this region shows a dynamics within and along the membrane upon channel opening. The proximity of the S1 and TM2ci regions is obvious in the closed M. tuberculosis MscL structure. An analysis of the equivalent residues to E. coli M12 and N103 is entirely consistent with our results that these residues, when mutated to cysteines, readily disulfide bridge and form a channel resistant to opening. On the other hand, several residue combinations, including the distal I3C and I96C, are not predicted to be close in the M. tuberculosis structure, do not lock the channel in the closed state when oxidized, but do stabilize substates. These data are consistent with the models for the dynamics of the S1 and TM2ci outlined above: upon gating the S1 helix slides along the cytoplasmic membrane, where it can interact with residues further up in the membrane portion of TM2 because of the tilting of this latter domain. Thus, overall the double cysteine mutants that bridge at high efficiency fall in two main categories: those that are predicted to be in close proximity from the closed structure and do lock the channel closed under oxidizing conditions, and those interactions consistent with the predicted sliding and tilting of these regions upon gating that show stabilized subconducting states when oxidized. Collectively, the data from this study, as well as many others, have led to a cohesive model of how MscL senses and responds to mechanical forces. We know, for instance, that MscL senses the tension in the membrane3; more specifically, changes within the lateral pressure profile.28 The observation that many other mechanosensors also have lower thresholds or are activated by amphipaths suggests this is a common stimulus for MS channels.29 Furthermore, the observation that the channel can function in a bilayer composed of phosphatidylcholine, which contains a zwitter-ionic headgroup not synthesized by E. coli, demonstrates that neither interactions with negatively charged lipids nor native lipid headgroups are required for normal MS channel activity.3 Both transmembrane domains tilt within the membrane, and TM1 rotates in a corkscrew fashion clockwise, as observed from the periplasm.1 Finally, this study has helped to define the interactions between the S1 and the TM2ci domains; the findings are consistent with the model of S1 maintaining its association with the cytoplasmic side of the membrane and thus serving as a stabilizer for the pore-forming TM1, and the dynamics of the TM2ci subdomain and the predicted tilting of TM2 within the membrane.",

    "abstract": "Single-celled organisms must survive exposure to environmental extremes. Perhaps one of the most variable and potentially life-threatening changes that can occur is that of a rapid and acute decrease in external osmolarity. This easily translates into several atmospheres of additional pressure that can build up within the cell. Without a protective mechanism against such pressures, the cell will lyse. Hence, most microbes appear to possess members of one or both families of bacterial mechanosensitive channels, MscS and MscL, which can act as biological emergency release valves that allow cytoplasmic solutes to be jettisoned rapidly from the cell. While this is undoubtedly a function of these proteins, the discovery of the presence of MscS homologues in plant organelles and MscL in fungus and mycoplasma genomes may complicate this simplistic interpretation of the physiology underlying these proteins. Here we compare and contrast these two mechanosensitive channel families, discuss their potential physiological roles, and review some of the most relevant data that underlie the current models for their structure and function.",
    "introduction": "Bacteria are well documented for their ability to survive and grow at extremes of osmolarity. Of particular note are the adaptations to high osmolarity, but these adaptations in themselves have required the evolution of strategies to deal with transitions in the environment from high to low osmolarity. To understand the latter, we need to describe the former. Bacterial adaptation to high osmolarity is multiphasic and engages the full panoply of cellular regulatory mechanisms, be they controls over gene expression or modulation of protein activity. Understanding the importance of these regulatory mechanisms requires an appreciation of the core physiology of the bacterial cell.",

    "abstract": "",
    "introduction": "The ability to detect mechanical forces is at the basis of not only the senses of touch, hearing and balance but also cardiovascular and osmotic regulation. In essence, mechanosensation is probably the oldest sense and is fundamental for many life functions. The primary way that organisms detect forces is through mechanosensitive (MS) ion channels. The best-studied mechanosensitive channels are from bacteria, and because relatively little is known of mechanosensors from higher organisms, these channels are a model for how a protein can sense and respond to mechanical forces. The mechanosensitive channel of large conductance (MscL) is a bacterial channel located in the cytoplasmic membrane that is gated by membrane tension (Blount et al., 2008a; Blount et al., 2007; Blount et al., 2008b; Booth and Blount, 2012). Although observed in the vast majority of bacterial species, the channels from Escherichia coli (E. coli) have been the best studied. The physiological role of MscL, and members of an unrelated bacterial mechanosensitive channel family, MscS (S for small conductance), is to serve as biological “emergency release valves” to protect cells from lysis upon an acute decrease in osmotic environment, commonly referred to as osmotic downshock; it accomplishes this by rapidly releasing cytoplasmic osmolytes (Booth and Blount, 2012; Levina et al., 1999). The MscL channel is less sensitive than MscS to membrane tension, but it generates a larger pore size, upwards of 30Å (Cruickshank et al., 1997), suggesting it is the last-ditch effort for survival. The MscL family is highly conserved and has a simple structural organization (Balleza and Gomez-Lagunas, 2009; Pivetti et al., 2003). This exaggerated response and simple construction lends itself as a paradigm for how MS channels, in general, can sense and respond to membrane stretch. X-ray crystallography has resolved a MscL homologue from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Tb-MscL) to be a homopentamer with each subunit containing an amphipathic N-terminal cytoplasmic α-helix running along the cytoplasmic membrane, followed by the two transmembrane α-helices (TM1 and TM2) that are connected by a periplasmic loop, and ending with the five C-terminal α-helixes forming a cytoplasmic helical bundle (Chang et al., 1998; Steinbacher et al., 2007) (also see Fig. 1A). A more recent structure has also been resolved for the Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) MscL orthologue (Sa-MscL), which shows a tetrameric rather than pentameric complex (Liu et al., 2009); however, this appears to be a detergent-induced oligomeric rearrangement since the channel forms almost exclusively pentamers in vivo (Dorwart et al., 2010; Iscla et al., 2011). Although the Sa-MscL structure is unlikely to be physiologically relevant, it is worth noting that many of the interactions between the transmembrane domains are similar to those observed in the Tb-MscL crystal structure, suggesting an overall structural conservation within this highly conserved family.",
    "results": "",
    "conclusion": "While several studies on Eco- or Tb-MscL have suggested that the periplasmic region may play a role in MscL channel regulation (Ajouz et al., 2000; Blount et al., 1996b; Jeon and Voth, 2008; Maurer et al., 2000; Maurer and Dougherty, 2003; Park et al., 2004; Tsai et al., 2005), no one had successfully identified a single sub-domain or residue that acted as a variable spring element, in either a consistent or opposing manner, across bacterial species. In this study, using a chimera approach we were able to identify such subdomains, and ultimately, a single residue. We initially found that the periplasmic loop of Eco-MscL confers short channel openings and that of Sa-MscL defines long openings. In contrast, the relatively conserved TM1/periplasmic lipid interface (44–49) influenced channel kinetics in an opposite manner with that from Eco-MscL effecting long open dwell times, and that from Sa-MscL generating short open dwell times. Thus, these two periplasmic regions appear to work in concert within these two orthologues, and the engineered combination of the Eco-MscL TM1/periplasmic lipid interface and the Sa-MscL periplasmic loop leads to MscL channels with a stabilized open state and extremely long open dwell times. The further dissection of the TM1/periplasmic loop interface led to the finding that a single residue at the lipid interface, I49 for Eco-MscL and the analogous site F47 for Sa-MscL, has profound effects on channel kinetics, thus suggesting an important role of protein-lipid interactions at this region. Furthermore, we generated one particular mutant by site directed mutagenesis, Sa-MscL F47L, which has an extreme channel phenotype in that it shows a severe hysteresis as well as delay in both opening and closing. These data demonstrate that not only can the energy barrier for gating, or the transition between closed and open states, be modified by a mutation at Sa-F47, but that the transition from closed to open can be drastically different from that for going from open to closed states. A recent molecular dynamic simulation study on Eco-MscL channel gating suggests that, during the gating process, membrane thinning induces a kink within the TM1/periplasmic loop interface, essentially in and around Eco-I49, which causes outward motion of the periplasmic loop away from the pore center (Deplazes et al., 2012). We propose that the easing or resisting of some restraint, such as this proposed kink formation, may modulate the transition between open and closed states, like adjusting the spring on a clasp knife. Studying additional channels altered by site-directed mutagenesis, we found consistent correlations between residue properties and their effects on channel function for Sa- as well as Eco-MscL; these data suggest a common functional role for this site between orthologues. As a general rule, hydrophobic residues led to longer open times, although streamlined hydrophobic residues appear to be more efficient in this aspect than those containing bulkier aromatic rings, presumably because of some sort of steric hindrance of the latter. The role of this residue in channel mechanosensation was also studied, and more hydrophobic substitutions were found to decrease mechanosensitivity. Therefore, increasing the hydrophobicity appears to increase the energy barrier required to achieve an open state, but once achieved, the open state is stabilized; increasing the hydrophilicity does the opposite, demonstrating that this spring element is adjusted by hydrophobicity. These findings are reminiscent of early studies suggesting that hydrophobic interactions, coined a “hydrophobic lock”, at the pore constriction keeps the channel closed; according to this theory, it is the exposure of these residues to the aqueous solution that is a major energy barrier for channel opening (Blount et al., 2007; Blount and Moe, 1999; Moe et al., 2000; Yoshimura et al., 1999). Note, however, that the “lock” is due to the bundling of hydrophobic residues from each of the subunits at the constriction of the pore, whereas here we found a residue at the lipid interface where no such bundling of residues is likely to occur. Although we found that the hydrophobicity of this spring element at the TM1 periplasmic lipid interface is important in both channel kinetics and mechanosensation, it is important to note that there are differences in the two correlations. For example, aromatic amino acids fit the hydropathy correlation for mechanosensation but not open dwell time. Several studies emphasize the importance of aromatics in potential lipid interactions for MscL (Sawada et al., 2012) as well as other mechanosensitive channels such as TRPY1 and other TRP channels (Su et al., 2007; Zhou et al., 2007) and belts of aromatics are seen in other membrane proteins, including KcsA (Doyle et al., 1998). Thus, aromatic residue-lipid interactions may play more of a role in mechanosensation than kinetics. We also observed that there is no correlation between mechanosensitivity and open dwell time for the various substitutions. Hence, although the relative hydrophobicity of this spring element effects changes in both kinetics and mechanosensation, it does so by different underlying mechanisms. In summary, by initially using a chimera approach, we identified a single amino acid serves as a “clasp knife spring” for the resistance and stability of channel opening and closing. The hydrophobicity and steric shape of this residue, complemented by the periplasmic loop, appears to define channel mechanosensitivity and kinetics in both Sa- and Eco-MscL.",
